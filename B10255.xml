            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But becauſe moſt Diſcourſes now publiſhed, are thought by the many that are able to judge, and the many more that are willing to cenſure, really to need
<pb facs="tcp:192161:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>their accuſtomed Apologies; let this be accepted for the Author of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was indiſpenſably ingaged to the publication of them, by a ſacred obligation, (how adviſedly entred into, is now too late to inquire) upon an extraordinary occaſion, which no other man can be concern'd to underſtand. This onely is to be added to complete the Apologie, for the Language and Method; that the faſhion of that plain Veſt wherein they are clothed, was not to be alterd or changed, <hi>Lev. 27.10.</hi> nor did it ſeem needful for them to whom it was deſigned.</p>
            <p>They onely are beholding to the Preacher, that ſtudies to ſeek out <hi>acceptable words for them,</hi> whoſe judgements are qualified with a capacity of being ſo gratified.
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.10.</note> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Perſons to whom theſe Meditations were firſt preſented, were of that form; nor are they yet intended for any ſuch, as can tell where to ſatisfie their curioſity in the many (perhaps too many) Diſcourſes that are purpoſely laboured for ſuch an end. The Knops, and the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with which the Golden Candleſtick, that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſervice of the Temple, was ſo curiouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, could be no advantage to the Lights which they ſuſtained, and yet were preciſely ordained to the glory of the Lord, whoſe dwelling was in that houſe. And they that now are able to offer any ſuch Lamps in Gods houſe, and do it with the ſame deſign, may hope to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; but if they have any other of their own, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if it be their own glory more than Gods, that they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly aym at, they will fall in with the perſons, of whom our Saviour ſpeaks,

               <pb facs="tcp:192161:3"/>of glorifying Gods, and working out our own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, are ſufficiently clear and manifeſt, at leaſt in ſome parts or other: ſo ought they to be ſet forth in the Sermons and Writings of them, whoſe office it is to guide men to theſe ends: When the Veil of <hi>Moſes</hi> his face is taken away by Chriſt, God forbid it ſhould be put on again by any of his Miniſters; which yet ſeems to be unhappily done, in this laſt age, by the overcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſubtile and ſcholaſtick Diſcourſes, and Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the great Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus; which can have no better effect upon the generality of Chriſtians, than to obſcure the matters which they pretend to clear. It was very much in this Authors deſire to ſcatter, or remove thoſe Clouds; which be thought was beſt to be done by abſtracting wholly from the conſideration of them, and by confining his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the grand Queſtion, What is to be done to work out a mans own Salvation, to the expreſs reſolutions of holy Scripture, illuſtrated and confirmed with the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſon, without reſpect to the Authoritie of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Teſtimonies. A few things onely he hath thought fit to add by way of Preface to each Diſcourſe, which he ſtrives to deliver with as much plainneſs, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will bear.</p>
            <p>And firſt to the firſt: That which inclined him to the publication of this familiar diſcourſe (at firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a ſmall and popular Auditory) was that he could not finde himſelf prevented by any other upon the ſame Subject, in our own Language. And it was mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wonder to him, how it ſhould come to paſs, that, that which is acknowledg'd the Supreme End, and Scope of all Religion, ſhould not fall under the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of ſo many Learned and Zealous Writers, as this Age hath produced: Or, how the diſtinct and juſt
<pb facs="tcp:192161:4"/>tractation of that great Duty, could come to be ſo much omitted, that ſcarce any thing to this purpoſe hath come to his knowledge, beſides the brief ſtrictures that are found in the School-men: whilſt the other Point (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting indeed the chief Good, and ultimate End of Mankind, in refeverence to himſelf) hath been the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of numberleſs Diſcourſes, as well of Chriſtian as Heathen Philſophers.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of what he hath ſought and deſiderated towards the declaring, directing, and preſſing that chief of Duties to the moſt high God, conſiſting in the ſeeking of his Glory; he hath in ſome late Authors, of good Learning, met with odd reflections of diſparagement of this End, as unworthy the excellency and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divine Nature, and too much reſembling the vanity of the Humane: Which miſpriſion of Error croſſing the many ſignifications of holy Scripture, and the general ſenſe and expreſſions of all religious minds, may poſſibly be removed, by the conſideration of a double glory belonging to the Divine Majeſty. The firſt is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal, and Eſſential; and therefore, infinite and immutable, incapable of receiving Addition, or Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution. The ſecond is Extrinſecal and Accidental, reſulting from his own Acts, and the Acts of his Creatures; and this is capable of being multiplied, and augmented; as the light of the Sun (which is its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) though we ſuppoſe it fix'd, and immutable in it ſelf, yet may, and doth receive innumerable varieties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection from other Bodies, which are beneath, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: Which reflections being agreeable to its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Nature, would be gratefully apprehended by it, if it had any ſenſe. So, though God can receive no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, or variations of his Eſſentiall Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; yet can be aſſume created Glories, and may
<pb facs="tcp:192161:4"/>clothe himſelf with Glory, and Majeſty, and deſigne to glorifie himſelf extrinſecally, as well by the Acts of his Creature, as by his own, multiplyed and varied, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the pleaſure of his Will: and ſo may be both glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and pleaſed, in ſuch a way, as is ſomething reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Radiations of the Sun, and their reſpective Reflections: So God can create glories wherewith to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and pleaſe himſelf, as well as to honour, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Creature. To this purpoſe doth the Holy Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſo often pray: <hi>Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, let thy glory be above all the earth.</hi> Pſal. <hi>57.5, 11.</hi> &amp; <hi>108.5. Let the whole earth be filled with his glory.</hi> Pſal. <hi>72.19.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That common piece of Vitioſity which abounds ſo much in men, taxed by the name of <hi>vain glory,</hi> is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproveable for its injuſtice, upon diverſe accounts; eſpecially, becauſe it is an affectation of more honour than is due, either without, or above the merits of the perſon that affects it: which may be done, by attributing to himſelf things worthy of honour, which are not at all in him: As, when an ignorant perſon judgeth himſelf, and would be judged wiſe, or learned, Or, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to himſelf more of thoſe things (worthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) than are found in him; as when a mean Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſhall deſire to be thought profoundly learn'd: Or, by eſteeming thoſe laudable things which are in him, worthy of greater honour than they are; as, when a witty Man, or fair Woman, ſhall think themſelves to deſerve as much reſpect as a Wiſe, or a Vertuous: Or, by an exceſſive affection to that honour which is due to him, preferring it before other ends, which are more value<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon a religious and reaſonable account: Or laſtly, by attributing, and aſſuming the merits of honour which are in him, intirely to himſelf, without acknowledgement
<pb facs="tcp:192161:5"/>of the prime and chief Author of them: All which things are branches of iniquity; and the laſt, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt act of injuſtice to God that can be, who, as he is the firſt cauſe of all that's worthy of honour; ſo, and therefore ought he alſo to receive the ultimate reflection thereof.</p>
            <p>But none of theſe things (but the direct contrary) is in God; who is infinitely worthy of all the Honour and Glory that is poſſible to be given him; and hath all this merit, intirely and ſolely from himſelf: And therefore, as the attribution of higheſt glory to him, is no more than juſtice to him: So the requiring of it from the Creature, is an Act of Juſtice to himſelf: And the deſigning, and accepting it when it is done, is no other than a delight in the Exerciſe of Juſtice, and Vertue, in thoſe Creatures, which are capable of giving it him, upon ſuch an account: So that Gods requiring inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and perfection of Glory from the Creature, and the pleaſure that he takes therein, hath preciſely the ſame reaſon with his requiring and being pleaſed with any acts of Piety or Vertue in his Creature. Thus much may ſuffice to clear the objection that hath been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods being ſo much pleaſed with that great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing all to his honour.</p>
            <p>Now the general Precept in the Text, being given by the Apoſtle in a particular caſe of Conſcience (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning eating things offerd to Idols) gave occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Author to ſpeak of ſome other Caſes of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occurrence in humane life: whereunto in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, he thinks it not amiſs to add the following reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a doubtful Conſcience; which he ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in a way borrowed from the ordinary Method of Demonſtrations, without pretending that they are exactly ſuch.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:192161:5"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> He takes leave to lay down the following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for his Principles.</p>
            <p n="1">

            <p>Now the general caſes of doubt to be reſolved by theſe Principles, are theſe three, to which all others may be reduced.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:192161:6"/>
            <p>
               <hi>1. Whether a particular action in queſtion be lawful, or not lawful; or, which is all one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be forbidden, or not forbidden.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>2. Whether a particular action in queſtion be commanded, or not commanded.</hi>

            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. Whether a particular action in queſtion be commanded, or forbidden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In each of theſe Caſes, the doubt is to be ſuppoſed only of the things ſpecified in the Caſe, other conſiderations being ſuppoſed to be out of doubt. Theſe things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, the reſolution is as followeth:</p>
            <p>In the firſt Caſe, where the onely doubt is whether the action in queſtion be lawful, or not lawful, (the doubt remaining) the action is to be forborn; by the firſt and ſecond Principle. <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe a man is bound to abſtain from all actions contrary to the glory of God; and every ſin is ſo: <hi>2.</hi> And every action done doubtingly is a ſin; likewiſe by the fifth and ſixth, becauſe in doubtful caſes the ſafeſt courſe is to be taken. And it is more ſafe to do that which I do not doubt to be lawful, than to do that which I do doubt whether it be lawful or not. Now the doubt being onely whether the action be lawful to be done, or not lawful; and not at all (in this Caſe) whether it be lawful to be forborn, the reſolution is cleer, by the foremention'd Principles; becauſe, if I do this action, I muſt neceſſarily ſin, whether the action in it ſelf (abſtracted from my doubt) be lawful, or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: If it be unlawful, I ſin doubly; <hi>1.</hi> by doing an action which in it ſelf is unlawful; <hi>2.</hi> by doing it, notwithſtanding my doubt: If it be lawful in it ſelf, as abſtracted from my doubt, yet under it, and with it, it is not, and therefore I muſt needs ſin in doing it; and therefore ought to forbear it. As for <hi>Example:</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb facs="tcp:192161:6"/>a man doubt whether it be lawful to eat blood or bloudings, upon the account of the Apoſtolical Canon, <hi>Acts 15.29.</hi> and ſome other Canons of Councils, and Opinion of the Primitive Church. In this Caſe, a man ought not to eat ſuch things, becauſe he doubts not at all the lawfulneſs of abſtaining from them, as having no colour of obligation upon him to eat: But whether it be lawful to eat, is his onely doubt, and that doubt makes it a ſin to him: Or, ſuppoſe a man to doubt whether it be lawful to lend money to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, or to play at Cards or Dice, or to drink a health upon the reflections of the Fathers upon thoſe things, as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Chriſtian ſobriety, or as things ſcandalous, and of no good report. He that doubts the lawfulneſs of thoſe things, though (whilſt he doth no more) he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not condemn the uſe of them in others, that are free from that doubt; yet is bound to abſtain from them himſelf, becauſe he is perfectly free ſo to do, as he is not in the uſe of them, by reaſon of his doubt.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Caſe, where the doubt is, whether the action in queſtion be commanded, or not commanded, the action is to be done by the ſame Principles; becauſe the onely doubt ſuppoſed in this Caſe, is whether the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be commanded, or not; and not at all whether it be lawful: ſo that it is ſuppoſed, out of doubt to be lawful to do it, and doubted onely whether it be lawful to omit it. In this Caſe, I ſay, a man is bound to do the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe if he doth it, he ſuppoſeth himſelf not to ſin, becauſe he doubts not the lawfulneſs of it. But if he doth it not, he muſt needs ſin, by the <hi>2.</hi> Principle: Either doubly by omitting that which is commanded, (and ſo obliging him before, and without his doubt, and alſo by omitting the ſame Duty doubtingly): Or at leaſt he muſt needs ſin ſingly, by acting doubtfully
<pb facs="tcp:192161:7"/>without neceſſity, and where a ſafer courſe was in his choice. As for Example: Suppoſe a man doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Canon, or Cuſtom of the Church to keep the Lent-faſt; or other Faſt-daies appointed by Law, do binde his Conſcience or not, having no reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for the omitting thoſe obſervances; but doth not at all doubt, but that it is lawful for him to keep them, whether in compliance with the Church, or upon other accounts. The reſolution of this doubt is plain; to wit, that the Faſts ought to be kept in this Caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot be omitted without ſin, whereas it is ſuppoſed they may be kept, without any doubt of ſin. In theſe two Caſes, the reſolution is demonſtrated by the foremention'd Principles.</p>
            <p>The onely difficulty is in the third Caſe, where the doubt is double, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the action in queſtion, be commanded, or forbidden. In this Caſe, (the doubt remaining) it ſeems impoſſible to avoid the neceſſity of ſinning, becauſe the action in it ſelf muſt either be forbidden, or commanded, or neither commanded, nor forbidden: Now if it be forbidden, and I do it with this doubt, I ſin doubly, as before was ſhewed; if I do it not, and it be commanded, I ſin likewiſe doubly upon the ſame account. If it be neither commanded, nor forbidden; yet I cannot but ſin whether I do it or no, becauſe I either do or leave undone a thing which I doubt whether I may lawfully omit, or do: For if a man muſt not chuſe to do a thing, which he doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may do or not, for that onely reaſon, becauſe he doubts; then neither may be omit an action, which he doubts whether he may omit or no. If then the Caſe be (as is ſuppoſed) that the doubt is whether a thing be commanded or forbidden (either directly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by God himſelf, in his Word, or the Law of right
<pb facs="tcp:192161:7"/>Reaſon, or indirectly, and mediately by his Authority veſted in lawful Governours, not exceeding their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion): the ſame reaſon that makes it unlawful to do it (<hi>viz.</hi> the doubt whether he may do it or no) will make it equally unlawful to omit it. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Suppoſe a man doubts of a ceremony in Gods Worſhip, commanded by the Church, whether it be not forbidden by God: In this Caſe the doubt muſt needs fall in both ways: For firſt, the Command of the Church is reaſon enough to doubt whether it be not commanded of God, becauſe that Authority by the Law of God extends to all things not forbidden by God, and the doubt whether it be forbidden or no, ſuppoſeth him not to know, or believe that it is; and therefore muſt needs leave him in doubt whether it be not commanded, becauſe if it be not forbidden, it is commanded. <hi>2.</hi> The reaſon of the doubt whether it be not forbidden by God, may be various taken from the Opinion of ſome Learned and good men, or grounded upon ſome dubious interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſome Texts of Scripture, or upon ſome miſtaken Principle, or ſeeming conſequence from a true one. The queſtion is, what is to be done in this Caſe, it being concluded by the third Principle, that it is abſolutely neceſſary for a man either to do, or not do it; neither of which elections can be made without ſin, by reaſon of the doubt both ways, as is ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>The common anſwer to this ſtreight, is, That a man ought to depoſe his doubt; which anſwer is perfectly unreaſonable in moſt Caſes, becauſe it is for the preſent impoſſible. It being not in the power of any man to ceaſe his doubting the truth of any propoſition immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and arbitrarily, without removing or ſolving the reaſons of his doubt: So that this adviſe to a diſtracted Conſcience is no better, than if a Phyſitian called to a
<pb facs="tcp:192161:8"/>ſick Patient, ſhould preſcribe for the onely remedy of his Diſtemper, an Exhortation to ſhake off his ſickneſs, or not to entertain it any longer, which would be taken for no better than a plain mocking the Patient. The onely reaſonable meaning that this advice can have, is, That a man ſhould do what in him lies to reſolve his own doubt, by labouring to underſtand the true reſolution of the Queſtion on either part: But this advice may be impracticabe in many Caſes, and is in all <hi>Extempore,</hi> where neither means, nor time is allowed ſufficient to effect it. The Queſtion then is, What other advice may be given for the preſent, and what reſolution is to be made thereupon.</p>
            <p>This Queſtion is onely capable of being reſolved by the fourth and the laſt Principles, which may be thus applied in all actions (and therefore in this, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my doubt) I am to act as reaſonably as I can; and it being ſuppoſed, that whether I do this action or omit it at this time, I muſt neceſſarily ſin, (becauſe I cannot depoſe my doubt, nor avoid ſin, if I act, or not act with it) I am to inquire what reaſon I have to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon one of theſe ſins rather than upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if I can finde any ſufficient to turn the Scale, that muſt determine my choice, by the laſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. And in this diſquiſition, the moſt conſiderable Reaſon of the Election to be made on either part, will conſiſt in the degree of the ſin, if any ſuch may appear, or be juſtly ſuſpected: For ſeeing the greateſt Reaſon that can be for the abſtaining from any action, is the avoidance of ſin, the dehree of the ſin, doth proportionably augment the Reaſon: If then the action, whereof I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould do it or not, hath to me an appearance of a greater ſin in the doing it, than it can be in the omiſſion; that Reaſon is very ſufficient to reſtrain me from the
<pb facs="tcp:192161:8"/>action, and oblige me to the forbearance, till I can be otherwiſe informed to the better ſatisfaction of my Conſcience: For,
<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 5.22.</note> when we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>abſtain from all appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> it is moſt reaſonable to conclude, that the appearance of the greateſt Evil, doth moſt ſtrongly oblige my abſtinence. As for Example: Suppoſe the action, whereof I am in doubt, hath an appearance of Idolatry; as in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> caſe, the eating things ſacrificed to Idols had, and as the worſhipping a piece of bread, or the invocation of Saints departed, may juſtly have: In ſuch caſes, I ſay, it is moſt reaſonable to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from the action, becauſe it is moſt ſafe ſo to do; becauſe by the doing of this action, I do at leaſt ſuſpect, I may be guiltie of Idolatry, which is a far greater ſin, than a bare omiſſion of an Act of obedience to any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority can be.</p>
            <p>The ſame reſolution upon parity of reaſon is to be made, where the omiſſion upon due conſideration may appear to be a greater ſin, than the performance of the action which ſeems to be the caſe of refuſing obedience to authoritie; cauſing diſorder, and having at leaſt an appearance of Schiſm, in matters of meer ceremony, or circumſtance in the publick worſhip of God, upon a bare ſuſpition of their want of allowance from God, or being ſome way forbidden: I ſay, That the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this caſe, if the action ſhould prove not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God, is a greater ſin than the action would be in obedience to authority, though it ſhould prove to be forbidden; whilſt we have ſo much reaſon to doubt whether it be or no: For it cannot with reaſon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the Tranſgreſſion of a Divine Precept (in a matter of circumſtance) ſo obſcurely revealed, as hath not been diſcover'd by the Catholick Church for
<pb facs="tcp:192161:9"/>many Ages, nor yet is by the Rulers, and moſt learned and pious Doctors and Paſtors of the preſent Church, can be ſo great a ſin, as is the tranſgreſſion of ſo plain a Precept, as that of obedience to authori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie; eſpecially when that diſobedience produceth the effects of Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Schiſm, Scandal, with ſeparation from the publick Worſhip of God, and privation of the means of his Grace. Theſe things conſidered, I ſay, it is not reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think, but that the ſin of diſobedience, in caſe the thing ſhould prove to be not forbidden (as by this doubt is ſuppoſed poſſible) is far greater than the doing of the act, though it ſhould prove to be forbidden. And therefore in this caſe, the action is to be done, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the doubt, by way of caution againſt a greater ſin: It being a greater ſin to diſobey doubtingly, than to obey doubtingly in ſuch a matter.</p>
            <p>But if for ought appears to me, there is no ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but that it may be as great a ſin to omit th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> action, as to do it, conſidering my doubt as well whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not commanded, as whether it be not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; I am then to conſider what other reaſons may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline me, either to the action, or to the omiſſion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of advantage, or diſadvantage to my ſelf or other on either ſide. As for Example: Suppoſe on the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, if I forbear the action, I do not onely ſin again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God, (upon one or both of the foremention'd accounts that is, as doing that which is forbidden in it ſelf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> forbidden to me, becauſe I doubt the lawfulneſs of it) but I alſo deprive my ſelf of many advantages which might have by the doing it, and incur conſiderable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in my Libertie, Eſtate, Reputation, with othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> incommodations to my friends. On the other ſide, if do the action, I do onely ſin againſt God, by acting doubtfully, or it may be by tranſgreſſing ſome unknown
<pb facs="tcp:192161:9"/>command, abſtracted from that doubt (which inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences are equally ſuppoſed in the forbearance:) But I avoid the forementioned diſadvantages, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring any other of equal concern. In this caſe, I ſay, it will be perfectly unreaſonable to chuſe the more haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardable reſolution, with rejection of the leſs: And therefore the reſolution will be as clear what is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to be done in this caſe, as is in any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; with this onely difference, That the practice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this duplicitie of doubt cannot be without a neceſſitie of ſin: What then can I, or ſhould I do more in this caſe, than this? commit my ſelf to the Mercie of God, with a cautionary profeſſion of my deſire to obey him: And that if I could any way poſſibly avoid the hazzard of tranſgreſſing his Will, I would do it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any motives whatever, reſpecting my ſelf, or mine own intereſt. But becauſe I cannot ſo do at this time, for want of preſent means to underſtand his Will; I act according to the general Rule, and law of my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is my reaſon, as far as it will afford me any direction, begging his pardon of my preſent ignorance, and the inevitable effect thereof.</p>
            <p>Againſt this reſolution, if it be objected (as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intimated) that there can be no ſuch neceſſitie of ſinning againſt God: Whilſt every man is bound to depoſe his doubt, and imbrace his Dutie: I anſwer firſt, That this deſtroyes the ſuppoſition of the Coſe, and therefore is no juſt Objection to the anſwer, which is given upon the admiſſion of it. <hi>2.</hi> That it is not true that there can be no ſuch neceſſitie of ſinning, or that every man is bound immediately to depoſe his doubt, though it be not in his power ſo to do. For though God doth not put a man upon any ſuch neceſſitie of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt himſelf, yet a man may by his own fault,
<pb facs="tcp:192161:10"/>and by his culpable ignorance, bring himſelf into this ſtreight.</p>
            <p>But here it muſt needs be obſerved, that the intire reſolution is grounded upon that Principle: <hi>That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is done doubtingly is a ſin:</hi> Which Principle I take up in this Diſcourſe, onely upon the account of its common reception, grounded upon the words of the Apoſtle: <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat.</hi> And therefore the reſolution, that ſuppoſeth this Principle, can be ſerviceable to ſuch onely as receive it.</p>
            <p>But whether this Maxime be univerſally true, or can be inferr'd from the Apoſtles Words, by the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſence of them, and whether it ought to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch actions as fall under the command of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not rather to be reſtrained to ſuch actions, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in that Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are indifferent in themſelves, and wherein a man is <hi>ſui juris,</hi> not ſuppoſed to be under command of authority either way, is a juſt Problem.</p>
            <p>For the Apoſtle in the Diſcourſe of that Chapter, wherein he delivers that concluſion: <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat,</hi> &amp;c. ſpeaketh onely of ſuch actions wherein a man is <hi>ſui juris,</hi> at perfect libertie, on one ſide at leaſt, that is, either to eat, or not to eat. For though he might have reaſon to doubt, whether it was lawful for him to eat ſuch meats, yet he is ſuppoſed to have none at all, to doubt but that it was clearly lawful for him to forbear, and therefore by the premiſed reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt queſtion, he ought not to eat with this doubt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon the objection from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which the vulgar Latine tranſlates <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernit;</hi> that is, maker difference or diſtinction of meats, thinking it not indifferent to eat of that meat: this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
<pb facs="tcp:192161:10"/>of ſence, was thought fit to be put in the Margent of our Engliſh Bibles, by the laſt Tranſlators. In which Caſe it is evident he muſt needs ſin, and that preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly againſt his Conſcience, and ſo is damned; that is, condemned by his own Conſcience, if he eats: But from hence there can be no ſuch concluſion made, as that he muſt needs ſin if he onely doubts; that being not the Apoſtles meaning by this tranſlation. And it is certain, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is ſo uſed in many Texts of ſcripture, as <hi>Act. 15.9. 1 Cor. 4.7. &amp; Jude 22. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: And of ſome have compaſſion making a difference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe the ſame word doth elſewhere as oft ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to doubt, and is ſo renderd in this Text by the <hi>Syriack,</hi> and moſt other Tranſlators, I adhere to that Tranſlation; and the rather becauſe, the following words are moſt conſonant to this ſence, <hi>Seeing he eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of faith:</hi> For though it be true indeed, that he that makes difference of meats, and eateth that which by ſuch difference, he eſteemeth to be unlawful, cannot cat of Faith, becauſe he eats directly contrary to it; yet is this a more jeune ſence, and not ſo proper, as to ſay, <hi>he that doubteth, eateth not of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Omitting therefore this Objection from the variety of tranſlation, I advance another more conſiderable; that is, whether becauſe he that <hi>eateth</hi> when he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whether it be lawful for him to eat, but is at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty not to eat, is <hi>damned?</hi> it will follow that whoſoever doth any action (wherein he hath no ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of forbearance) with any doubt, be in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner condemned. As for Example: He that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by lawful Authority to do an action, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he doubts whether it be lawful by the law of God or no, to do it: It is certain, this perſon
<pb facs="tcp:192161:11"/>if he were free, ought not to do this action, becauſe of his doubt, whilſt he might forbear it without any doubt: But under this command, he hath no more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to forbear this action, than he hath to do it; And therefore it will not follow by this inſtance of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, wherein the caſe is ſo different, that he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſin if he do it, more than if he do it not.</p>
            <p>But it may be urged, that although from the firſt words of that Text <hi>(he that doubteth is damned if he eat)</hi> this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal concluſion, cannot be inferred; yet from the next words, which are added as a reaſon thereof, it may, <hi>Seeing he eateth not of faith, and whatſoever is not of faith is ſin.</hi> For thus it may be urged: <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin:</hi> But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is done doubtingly, is not of Faith; <hi>Ergo,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is done doubtingly is ſin. The <hi>1.</hi> of theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit ons is expreſly aſſerted by the Apoſtle; and the ſecond ſeems to be rightly collected from the connection of thoſe words,
<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, quoniam, ac quia.</note> He that <hi>doubteth is damned if he eat, ſeeing</hi> (or becauſe) <hi>he eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of faith:</hi> Which reaſon would not be true, if it were poſſible, notwithſtanding the doubt, to eat of Faith. And if that be not poſſible in this inſtance, it may ſeem to be ſo in all others: whence the univerſal concluſion will be inferred rightly.</p>
            <p>To this Argument, a rejoynder may be offer'd to this ſence; That there is no neceſſary conſequence, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the univerſal Propoſition, from the particular Caſe; admitting the truth of that univerſal Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſin,</hi> without any limitation in the matter; and underſtanding Faith, (as in that Text it can onely be meant) to ſignifie no more than a perſwaſion of the lawfulneſs of the action to him that doth it. May it not be ſaid, that although
<pb facs="tcp:192161:11"/>in that Caſe, he that doubteth onely whether it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to eat, and not at all whether it be lawful to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, cannot eat of Faith, becauſe it is at his free choice, to forbear the action that he doubts, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine himſelf to that wherein he hath no doubt; yet in another Caſe, where the action is doubful both waies, it may be poſſible, notwithſtanding his doubt, to act in Faith. For, as many things may be lawful to be done, whilſt they are left free, being not forbidden by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which are not lawful, when they are forbidden, though but by men: So may ſome things be unlawful to be done, when they are not commanded, that yet may be lawful when they are. It may be as great a ſin to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey an unlawful command, as to give it; if he that diſobeys, knows no better for his diſobedience, than he that gave the command, did for his giving it. Of this kinde are doubtful actions, which are not to be done, when a man is free, for that onely reaſon, becauſe they are doubtful: The doubt being a ſufficient reaſon to bar the lawfulneſs of the action, as before hath been ſaid: But when a man is not free, but under the obligation of Authoritie, every doubt is not a ſufficient reaſon to make a thing unlawful: So that in ſuch a Caſe a man may, notwithſtanding his doubt, be perſwaded of the lawfulneſs of-his action, unleſs that doubt be grounded upon reaſons, more credible than is the judgement of the perſons, by whom that action is recommended to us, as not onely lawful, but expedient.</p>
            <p>But further, that it may be poſſible for a man, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his doubt, concerning the lawfulneſs of an action in it ſelf, to have a juſt perſwaſion that it is lawful for him in a preſent Caſe, I offer theſe grounds of Reaſon.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:192161:12"/>
            <p>
               <hi>1.</hi> That all manner of doubts do proceed from ignorance.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That ſome ignorance may be inculpable, as well as culpable, and that not onely in matters of meer Faith, but alſo in practical matters: For as there are many divine verities, contained in the true ſence of holy Scripture, and the neceſſary conſequences thereof, which are not underſtood by the Learned, much leſs by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned, and yet that ignorance is inculpable in the Learned, and much more in the unlearned. So may there be divers practical concluſions, inferring the Obligation of juſt Precepts, to them that do or are bound to underſtand them: which, perſons unlearned may be inculpably ignorant of, for want of that underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Original Texts, or that faculty of deducing conſecuences, by Art of Logick, or extraordinary perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Reaſon, which they are not obliged to have. In this Caſe the ignorance of thoſe practicab Precepts, ſo obſcurely revealed in holy Scripture, may be inculpable, as I ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Where the ignorance is inculpable, the doubt is ſo too.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Inculpable ignorance, as well concomitant, as cauſal, doth excuſe the Act that is done with it, (though contrary to a Precept) from ſin, not onely <hi>a tanto,</hi> but <hi>à toto.</hi> I uſe the term <hi>(inculpable)</hi> rather than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, becauſe it is more clear, and leſs liable to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: Nor are thoſe terms equivalent: For both ſome ignorance may be invincible in ſome circumſtances, which is not inculpable; and ſome ignorance may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpable, which is not ſimply invincible; for to render ignorance inculpable, it is not neceſſary that it was not to be prevented by any poſſible induſtry; but it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth, that it doth not proceed from the neglect of any means, that a man was bound to have uſed; or, from any other fault of the ignorant perſon. Inculpable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
<pb facs="tcp:192161:12"/>I ſay, excuſeth any action that is done with it from ſin, as well <hi>à tanto</hi> as <hi>à toto,</hi> and as well when it is barely concomitant, as when it is cauſal. This concluſion is diſagreeable to the ordinary reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Schools: and yet ſeems to be true, upon this reaſon, becauſe inculpable ignorance barreth the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of a poſitive law, which cannot oblige, till it be ſo promulged, as obligeth all them that are to be bound by it, to the knowledge thereof: And though actual knowledge of a law be not neceſſary to the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it, yet promulgation is, and that ſuch as is ſufficient to take off all excuſe of ignorance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to render it not inculpable: And where there is no law actually obliging, there can be no ſin. Therefore inculpable ignorance, as well of the law, as of the fact excuſeth from ſin: and that not onely when that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a cauſe <hi>(ſine qua non)</hi> of the action, which a man would not do if he knew of the law, but alſo when the ignorance doth onely accompany the action, which a man would have done, though he had known the Law: The diſpoſition of the will to do ſuch an evil action, though it were known to be ſo, is indeed a ſin; but the action it ſelf cannot be a ſin, whilſt it is not forbidden to the Agent, by any obliging law.</p>
            <p>To apply theſe Propoſitions to the Queſtion premiſed: ſeeing all manner of doubt proceeds from ignorance, and that ignorance may be inculpable; and where the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is inculpable, ſo is the doubt; and inculpable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a law, takes away the Obligation, and therefore excuſeth from ſin: it ſeems to follow, that when a man is inculpably ignorant of any ſuch law, as forbids the action which he deliberates about, he may act with perſwaſion concerning the lawfulneſs thereof to him: Though he ſhould have ſome reaſon to doubt whether
<pb facs="tcp:192161:13"/>ſuch a Law may not be: For whether there be, or there be not, if he be inculpably ignorant of it, it obliges him not: And therefore he is at libertie to act, or forbear according to reaſon, and may do either of Faith; that is, though he doubts upon ſome uncertain account, (not obliging his belief) whether the action to be done, be not forbidden by ſome Law of God; yet if he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpably ignorant of the Law, it doth not oblige him; and therefore leaves him free, till he be ſo far inſtructed, as he can plead no inculpable ignorance. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Suppoſe the Law forbidding an action be no where in Scripture ſet forth expreſly, and the onely evidence thereof depends upon doubtful interpretations of Scripture, or ſubtle conſequences, diſputed and denyed by good and learned men, of equal credit, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, or determin'd by any Authoritie of the Church. In this Caſe I being no competent judge of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, may ſuppoſe myſelf inculpably ignorant of that Law, as well as I am of other verities and points of belief, that have no other, or no better evidence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; whilſt yet pretenſions of reaſons not cogent, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Opinions of Learned men, may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make me doubt, as well of the uncertain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as of other verities. I inquire now whether not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this doubt, I may not act in Faith? that is, believing it ſtill lawful for me to do this action, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it ſelf it be forbidden, or not forbidden; becauſe the Law whereby it is forbidden (if it be ſo) under this inculpable ignorance, doth not yet oblige me; and if I believe my ſelf not obliged by a law, I may act in Faith; that is, with perſwaſion that I am free, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my ignorance be in truth inculpable, or not; yet if I be perſwaded that it is ſo, its certain I may have the ſame perſwaſion concerning the lawfulneſs of the
<pb facs="tcp:192161:13"/>action, that I do againſt no other law than that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I think my ſelf inculpably ignorant: It is true, if my ignorance be not inculpable, I ſhall ſin in this action, but ſhall notwithſtanding act in Faith, notwithſtanding my doubt; whilſt that doubt is not whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to do this action, in this caſe of ignorance (for that would impart a contradiction to my Faith, or perſwaſion, that it is) but onely whether there be not ſome law forbidding the action in general, and obliging all that know it, or ſhould know it; but not obliging me (as I ſuppoſe) becauſe I am as yet ignorant thereof, and that, as I believe, inculpably.</p>
            <p>But here it is to be conſidered, that although it be certain, (by the expreſs words of the Apoſtle) That <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſin;</hi> yet it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that whatſoever is of faith is not ſin. For then St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not ſinned whilſt he perſecuted the Church: for he ſaith, <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus,</hi> Acts <hi>26.9.</hi> And therefore though a man, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch a doubt, as hath been declared, may act in Faith, (which was the onely thing indeavoured to be proved) yet it will not follow that he ſins not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his ignorance be inculpable. And if he onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that it is ſo, he may likewiſe for that reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it is no ſin; but can have no more certainly of the innocencie of his act, than he hath of the incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableneſs of his ignorance.</p>
            <p>If this Hypotheſis ſeem to deſtroy the ſecond Principle before delivered, with the reſolutions of the Caſes, made upon it. I anſwer, <hi>1.</hi> As before was intimated, that, that Principle in thoſe indefinite termes, wherein it is firſt laid down, was taken up, upon the common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the univerſal truth of it; and the reſpective
<pb facs="tcp:192161:14"/>reſolutions ſuppoſing it, were accordingly framed. But <hi>2.</hi> If that Principle be reſtrained (as I underſtand it) to ſuch a doubt as is made, not onely concerning the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a poſitive Law, but concerning the Obligation of it to me; that is, if I doubt whether the action be lawful to me, and not onely whether it be lawful in it ſelf, or not forbidden by ſome Law unknown to me; I ſay, If this be the doubt, the Principle will be true, and the Reſolutions upon it certain, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to this Hypotheſis. Theſe cautions premiſed, I ſhall proceed to give an inſtance or two of the Caſe; 1. Some Divines have aſſerted the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to forbid all manner of Ceremonies, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded in Scripture to be uſed in Divine Worſhip: Suppoſe this aſſertion ſhould be true, can it be ſaid to be ſufficiently evident to oblige my belief, or to convict me of any culpable ignorance, whilſt I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it not; being no otherwiſe declared than in the terms of that Commandment, forbidding nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, beſides the making and worſhipping of Images, and having no evidence for this comprehenſion of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Ceremonies, other than from the interpretation of thoſe Divines, contradicted by moſt other Divines of equal judgement at leaſt? whether now is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of thoſe Divines, that affirm the Prohibition of un-inſtituted Ceremonies from that Commandment, a ſufficient Promulgation of that Law to me. If it be, it muſt certainly be ſuch as obligeth my belief: for, I cannot be bound to obey a Law, which I am not bound to believe to be a Law, becauſe then my obedience could not be grounded upon my faith, as all obedience ought to be. But how can I in reaſon be obliged to believe this interpretation, upon the account of their aſſertion, whilſt I know it to be denyed by others of equal credit, and
<pb facs="tcp:192161:14"/>greater Authority. And if that Interpretation be not a ſufficient Promulgation of this ſuppoſed Law, how am I, that have, either no other, or no better evidence for it, obliged by it, though it were a Law. And if I be not, why may I not act in Faith, (eſpecially when I am commanded by juſt Authority to the Act) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my doubt, whether that interpretation may not poſſibly be true? Why may I not perſwade my ſelf, that if this ſhould be the ſence of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am not at all obliged by it, till I have ſome better evidence thereof.</p>
            <p>Or, <hi>2.</hi> Let the Queſtion be whether it be lawful to uſe any ſet Forms of Prayer? It is certain, this is no where expreſly forbidden in Scripture: But ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have judg'd it unlawful, and given ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for their opinion, depending upon uncertain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or unneceſſary conſequences: Suppoſe now a weak judgement be induced to doubt the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any forms, upon the account of theſe Divines Opinion, and Arguments againſt them. This doubt muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe ignorance, becauſe if the truth were known, the doubt could not remain; is then this ignorance culpable, or inculpable? If it be culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then the doubt is ſo too; and then the party was bound to believe that Opinion without any doubt, notwithſtanding whatever reaſons he might have to the contrary: If it be inculpable, (whilſt he hath no better evidence to determine his belief) how can he be hound to forbear the uſe of Forms, by any Law whereof he is thus ignorant, notwiſtanding his doubt, which doth not take away, but neceſſarily infer the ignorance, which would be impoſſible without it? May be not therefore, notwithſtanding this doubt, make uſe of Forms, with perſwaſion that to him it is yet lawful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to all them to whom this Goſpel is ſufficiently revealed, the Chriſtian Faith, or Faith in Chriſt, is abſolutely neceſſary to render their works pleaſing to God: And that Faith is undoubtedly the principal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is Faith in Chriſt the Saviour that gives us <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with him, and his Church; and that conſequently gives the firſt right to that Salvation, which is procured by him, and is the onely priviledge of his Church.

            <p>Faith is the prime Article of the New Covenant; And in congruity to the deſign of mans Redemption and Salvation by Chriſt; the principal act of this Faith, is to receive him, as the Author of this Salvation, and to depend upon him, and the expiation that he hath made for us by his blood: But becauſe he is alſo propounded to us in the ſame Goſpel, as Chriſt, the anoynted of the Lord, as well for a Prophet and a King, as a Prieſt; and ſent by his Father to declare the Minde and Will of God in his Precepts, as well as to publiſh his Grace

And thus much is included in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Faith, given unto him when they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed for his Diſciples, which is the ſolemn Rite of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging our Faith unto him.</p>
            <p>For that Faith which is profeſſed in our Baptiſm, is undoubtedly the ſame with that by which we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſaved: But the Faith which is profeſſed in Baptiſm, is not a bare truſt in Chriſt as a Saviour, but a Faith given unto him as our Lord and Maſter, to become his faithful Diſciples, importing our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire to learn, and ſtipulation to obſerve his Precepts: And therefore as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>we are ſaved by faith,</hi> Eph. <hi>2.8.</hi> So S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Baptiſm doth alſo ſave us, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>3.21.</hi> Interpreting his meaning, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>Not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer</hi> (or ſtipulation) <hi>of a good conſcience.</hi>

            <p>And to this purpoſe it is obſervable, that when our Saviour gave commiſſion to his Apoſtles to go and make Diſciples of all Nations,

               </hi> the Saviour, we are ſaved. But as that unbelief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb facs="tcp:192161:17"/>deſtructive by its effects, as a practical infidelity, producing diſobedience to the Commandment: So is our Faith effectual to Salvation, then onely, when it is ſincerely practical, reducing us to our duty of obedience to our merciful Saviour.</p>
            <p>If that ſaying of the Father muſt ſtand for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Axiom, <hi>bona opera ſunt via ad regnum, non cauſa regnandi,</hi> I muſt have leave to interpret the latter Clauſe, ſo, as may import no contradiction to the firſt; that is, that good works are the way to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not <hi>the Cauſe</hi> (that is, the principle, or meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cauſe) of our raigning; for <hi>a Cauſe</hi> they muſt needs be; that is, a moral Cauſe, if they be the way; that is, the means of our raigning, as that ſignifies not onely the Term or End of this way, but the Reward of our walking in it.</p>
            <p>When therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> excludes works from juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, I take it, his onely ſcope is, to ſecure the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and aſſert the neceſſity of Divine Grace purchaſed by Chriſt, and promiſed by the New Covenant of the Goſpel. And when he ſaith a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, he ſometimes means ceremonial works, ſuch as was that of Circumciſion, and the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that whole Law, which a man was made a debtor to keep by his Circumciſion, <hi>Gal. 5.3.</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles by the righteouſneſs of works he ſeems to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, perfect indefective obedience to the whole Law, or Will of God: upon which account it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a ſinner (as he concludes all men to be now, <hi>Rom. 3.23. Gal. 3.22.)</hi> to be juſtified, becauſe his being ſo, imports a contradiction to ſuch Works: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is obſerveable, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth never ſay, that a man can be ſaved without Works; but that he is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
<pb facs="tcp:192161:18"/>without them; ſpeaking generally of the firſt juſtification, or being put into a ſtate of juſtification, by the free pardon,

            <p>To this tacit Objection the Apoſtle Anſwers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:192161:21"/>that this they might do, ſo that it were without Scandal: as, if it were meat ſold in the Shambles (where ſome portions of Heathen Sacrifices might ſometime be ſold);
<note place="margin">v. 25.</note> or ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them at a private Table, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they were invited, <hi>v,</hi> 27. in ſuch caſes they might eat freely without any queſtion. But if any man did take, or give notice of ſuch meat, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that it was a portion of an Idol- Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and as ſuch, eaten in the company, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that Sacrifice, then, and in that caſe, they ought not to eat of it; for his ſake that ſhewed it, and for conſcience ſake, not their own, but his or theirs who are ſubject to be ſcandalized there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, by being confirmed in the ſin of Idolatry: which Scandal is a thing that tends much to the prejudice of Gods glory, which ought ever to be reſpected by a Chriſtian, <hi>Whether he eat or drink or whatſoever he doth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ſtands the Coherence, and Occaſion of the <hi>Text:</hi> Wherein may be noted theſe two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral parts; <hi>Actus, &amp; Finis ſive regula:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Actions of men, which are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated and ordered by a certain rule and end. Theſe are ſet down, 1. particularly by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or Induction, <hi>Whether ye eat or drink:</hi> 2. generally, with an univerſal <hi>et caetera; or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye do,</hi> Secondly The end or rule whereto or whereby, all theſe Actions are to be directed, is, <hi>the glory of God: Do all to the glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This general precept, or Exhortation, reduced into a Doctrinal propoſition, teachethus: that <hi>It is the Duty of Chriſtians whether they eat or drink or whatſoever they do, to do all to the glory of God:</hi> which propoſition my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:192161:22"/>intention is to handle in the plaineſt method of Explication, Confirmation, and Application.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of Explication I ſhall enquire, What is meant by the glory of God, 2. What Actions of men are to be directed to this end; 3. How all ſuch Actions may, and ought to be regulated by, or directed to this End.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to conſider, What is meant by the glory of God. Anſwer; Glory is nothing but the manifeſtation of ſome eminent Excellency or Dignity, that appeareth in, or is attributed, and aſcribed to, a thing, or perſon: ſo that it is either abſolute, by way of Inherence or Emanation, or relative by way of Reflection or Attribution. Accordingly this word <hi>Glory</hi> in reference to God, doth ſometimes ſignifie the high and glorious Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminency, Majeſty, and Excellency of God, who is all Glory, in his Eſſence, Acts, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; In all that he is, in all that he doth, and in all that can be truly conceived or ſpoken of him. And as with men, Titles of Dignity are commonly uſed to expreſſe, or deſignate, the perſons to whom they are attributed; as when we ſay, <hi>his Majeſty, his Highneſs, his Excellency, Honour, or Worſhip,</hi> we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Perſon himſelf; ſo in holy <hi>Scripture</hi> by the glory of God, ſometimes the <hi>Deitie</hi> it ſelf, and ſometimes the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the Deitie to which it is given, is expreſſed: [As 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.17, <hi>Then came a voice from the Excellent glory,</hi> that is, from God the Father] and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1, 3. <hi>Who</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>being the brightneſs of his Glory;</hi> that is of God the Father's glory, <hi>and the expreſſe image of his Perſon</hi> or ſubſtance; the latter words expounding the former.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:192161:22"/>
            <p>2. Glory in reference to God is uſed alſo, for all ſignes teſtimonies, and manifeſtations of his preſence, and many times for that peculiarity of praiſe, honour, and reverence, that is given, or to be given to God, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.2. <hi>Give unto God the glory that is due unto his name,</hi> that is, the honour, as it is in the Margin. To give glory to God, is to apprehend, and acknowledg his glorious Excellency, Majeſty, and Supereminency, and to ſhew our reverence thereof, by Words, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; this is to ſanctify his name, and to glorifie him as God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. <hi>To give unto him the glory that is due to his Name,</hi> that is, to Him, (for the Name of God ſignifies Himſelf) and to him alone ſeparately, as the Holy One, that is, the Only God. For he will not that his Glory (in any part or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) be given to another. As when the Heathens did Sacrifice to Idols, if Chriſtians did partake with them in their Feaſts of joy and honour to thoſe Idol Gods, this was to give the Glory of God to Idols, by acknowledging in them, a kind of Deity, becauſe Sacrifice is an honour, or worſhip, peculiar to God; thus ſhould he be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of his Glory Which is the only thing that he is jealous of. This latter Signification of the word is that which is meant in this Text.</p>
            <p>Second Queſtion: What are thoſe Acts of men which are to be directed to this end? Anſwer: This Queſtion is fully anſwered by the Apoſtle:</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of inſtance in ſome Common natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Actions, ſuch as thoſe of eating and drinking, which were the particular Acts now in queſtion, and which is the reaſon of his naming them only.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:192161:23"/>
            <p>2. But withall, he ſhews the Extent of this Rule to be univerſal, reaching to all manner of humane Actions, <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall more diſtinctly remonſtrate the juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this rule in the following Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Rule is principally to be underſtood of humane Actions, properly ſo termed; that is, ſuch Actions, as are under the direct Government of Reaſon, which is the difference of a Man from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures. All arbitrary and voluntary Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as are under the Direction and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the underſtanding, and will of man, and ſo are capable of being deſigned to an end theſe, are all to fall under this Rule.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Propoſition: By <hi>doings</hi> in this Text, are comprehended, the Acts of the whole man, that is his thoughts alſo, and words, which (though it vulgar ſpeech, they be ordinarily diſtinguiſhed from actions, yet) are the moſt true and proper Acts of a man, as being incommunicate to other Animals, and therefore do as much fall under this rule as any outward Actions whatſoever. Thoughts Reaſonings of the Mind, and all elicit, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts of the Will, and Affections, are firſt to be regulated by this end. All manner of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo to be governed, as God may be glorified at leaſt not diſhonoured, by them; A Chriſtian mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> look to all his Affections, and Paſſions, of love hatred, deſire, delight, grief, fear, hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they be ſo placed, and ſo managed, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as Gods glory may receive ſome Service, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> leaſt no diſ-ſervice from them. Whatever we ſpeak or think, we muſt therein have a due regard
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192161:23"/>to the glory of God; who may be as much glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or diſhonoured by theſe waies, as by deeds.</p>
            <p>The like Extent hath this word <hi>do,</hi> in that other general Rule of our Actions, in reference to one another, before named, <hi>Whatſoever yee would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye unto them likewiſe.</hi> That Rule alſo is to be underſtood of Affections, as well as Actions, and to be obſerved alike, both in thoughts and words, as well as deeds: and in all theſe, not only with reſpect to meer Juſtice, but to Charity eſpecially, as appears by the Context in our Saviour's application of that Rule, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6, 30, 31, 32.</p>
            <p>Third Propoſition: Not only the matter of our doings, is to be ordered by this rule; but alſo the manner, circumſtances, and all inferiour ends; that is, it behoveth Chriſtians to be carefull, not only that the matter of their doings be conſiſtent with, and ſubordinate to the Glory of God; but alſo that the manner, circumſtances, motives, and all ends of them, be likewiſe governed by the ſupreme End. For in theſe things eſpecially conſiſts the morality, and Regularity of humane Actions; which are good or evil particularly, in reſpect of the motives, manner, circumſtances, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. Hence not only indifferent, but good actions (in themſelves and in reſpect of the matter of them) may be ſo Circumſtantiated, and intended, or deſigned, as God may be much diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured by them: This Action of eating things Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to Idols, was in it ſelf an indifferent thing, as the Apoſtle declares in the preceding verſes, but by circumſtance of place, or company, it became unlawful, as it was prejudicial to the glory of God,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192161:24"/>by way of Scandal. So in common eating and drinking, it is not the matter, or object of theſe Actions; but the manner, ends, and circumſtances of quantity, quality, time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by this end. In good and religious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the manner and intention is ſpecially to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, that they be ever done in faith and ſincerity, without negligence, or irreverence, with pure and holy intention, and zeal to the glory of God; elſe they loſe their Religion, as ſhall be ſhewed again hereafter,</p>
            <p>But here a Queſtion may be moved, Whether it be poſſible that all manner of humane Actions can be directed to ſo high an end, as the glory of God: For it may ſeem that this end is too high for ſome Acts to be deſigned unto.</p>
            <p>Anſwer: It appears clearly by the inſtances which the Apoſtle hath given in the Text, of Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drinking, (which are no other than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Actions, common to brute beaſts) that there are no humane actions ſo minute, indifferent, or inconſiderable, in their kind, but may come under this Rule, and be ſubordinated to this general end of Gods glory: which as it is the only deſign of God himſelf; ſo, (and therefore) ought it to be the deſign of all reaſonable creatures, as creatures as you ſhall hear: And that the height of this end doth nothing hinder the direction, or ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the leaſt actions thereunto, may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we will but conſider, that all things in the world though never ſo low and baſe in their appearance, do, notwithſtanding, in their kind, and order, reach this ſame end: not only Man but the very Beaſt, may and doth glorify God,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192161:24"/>even in its eating and drinking; and all creatures elſe, even to the leaſt and loweſt, do ſerve this end; that is, they do declare the Glory of God: Not only the Heaven, the Sun, Moon and Starrs in their magnitude, motions, lights, and ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, do declare the Glory of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 72.19.24. 1, 33.5.104.24.119.64.</note> but <hi>the whole Earth and the fulneſs thereof, is full of his Glory,</hi> in as much as it is full of his goodneſs, mercy, riches; every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Being, together with every accident, quality, figure, motion, and operation thereof doth ſignally declare the glory of Gods power, wiſdom, and providence, were it perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood. Hence the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> calls upon all creatures to praiſe the Lord, <hi>Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapours, ſtormy Winds which execute his Word; Mountains and all Hills, fruitful Trees and all Cedars, Beaſts and all Cattel, creeping things and Feathered Fowls,</hi> Pſal 148.7, 8. &amp;c. And ſure, it is as eaſie to underſtand, and believe that the leaſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of humane Actions, ſhould be directed to the glory of God, as that the leaſt Creature, Energy, Accident or Motion of a Creature (even to the lighting of a Sparrow upon the ground,
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.29.</note> and to the numbering of hairs upon a mans head) ſhould be under the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice and Government of his Providence; as is, or ought to be believed by all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. If the infinite glorious wiſdom of God doth extend it ſelf to the taking notice of all that is under him, and all that is in, or done by any of his Creatures, (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it doth) though no meaner a man than
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:192161:25"/>Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hierom in</hi> 1. <hi>cap. Habac.</hi> v. 13.</note> by a moſt incredible Miſtake doth ſeem to deny it, as much as <hi>Epicurus</hi> or any of his School) much more is he to be thought to have a ſpeciall regard to all the Acts of Man, whoſe Being is the ſecond in honour after his Own. And if God takes notice of all our actions, they muſt needs ſome way or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his Glory, and ought much more to be noted and obſerved by our ſelves.</p>
            <p>But for a more clear and full Satisfaction to this Objection, I ſhall now proceed to the third Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which only remains to be anſwered, for the compleat Explication of the whole Doctrine, that is, How the glory of God is to be reſpected in all our actions, or, How all the actions of men may, and ought to be regulated with reſpect to this end.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Branch of my anſwer to this queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, ſhall be that which I take to be the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment, and ſcope of the Apoſtle in this place; which is, that Chriſtians in all their actions, ſhould have ſuch a conſtant and heedfull regard to the glory of God, as that nothing be done by them to the prejudice, or derogation thereof, in any degree; that is, that no diſhonour may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to God, by, or from any of their actions, in reſpect of the matter, manner, circumſtances or end of them. This is the moſt general ſenſe of the Rule, and that which ſeems primely intended in this place, as may appear plainly from the Context: wherein the Apoſtle admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Corinthians (who lived among hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and were ſuch, till ſome of them had been
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:192161:25"/>lately converted to the Faith of Chriſt) not to eat of things offered to Idols, for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſo doing, would be repugnant to the glory of God, which ought alwaies to be reſpected by Chriſtians, in whatſoever they do.</p>
            <p>Now God, is diſhonoured by the breach of his Law, <hi>Rom</hi> 2, 23. <hi>Thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the Law, through breaking the Law diſhonoureſt thou God?</hi> More particularly, firſt by all ſuch Actions as are evil in themſelves; or ſecondly, by ſuch as (being good, or indifferent in themſelves) are evilly performed in reſpect of the manner, circumſtances, or ends of them; or thirdly by ſuch as have an appearance of evill. 1. By ſuch actions as are clearly evil in themſelves in reſpect of the matter of them; by all ſuch actions God is diſhonoured, aſwell ſuch as are committed againſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as ſuch as are committed immediately againſt God himſelf; whether the eidence of that evil proceeds from any written Word of God, or only from the common Law of reaſon, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underſtanding. For that ſame <hi>Effect of the Law wittten in the heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.15. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> attributes to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, being equally common to Chriſtians, doth equally bind them, and cannot be ſuperſeded, or made void by the knowledg of the Written Law, which ſerves to perfect it. So that whiles the defect of that Law in the heart is only ſupplied by the Word, the Effect of it ſtill remaines: And if a Heathen ſhall be judged for things done by him, only againſt the Law of reaſon, his own conſcience accuſing him, as the Apoſtle ſaith, though he knows of no writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:192161:26"/>Law of God againſt it; then doubtleſs ſo ſhall a Chriſtian be, for all ſuch Actions as he ſhall do againſt the ſame Law of his Reaſon and Conſcience, notwithſtanding he either knows not, or cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any written word againſt it; For this Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, as to ſuch particular Actions, is the ſame in both. For, although the Law of God, which is written in the Scriptures, be ſaid to be perfect, and thereupon is ſuppoſed to declare, in the Latitude of it's Senſe, and the juſt Conſequences thereof, the whole Will of God, that is, his preceptive Will, in whatſoever he requires, or forbids men to do: yet becauſe this perfection of Senſe, with the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, is not perfectly underſtood by any man, much leſs by all; therefore may there be many things therein required and forbidden, which will not from thence be particularly underſtood, much leſs remembred at all times. If therefore the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a man from clear light of Reaſon, ſhall condemn any Action, which he is any way tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do, although he doth not remember any particular Text of Scripture whereby it is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he is nevertheleſs bound to abſtain from it, by that Law written in the Heart, and cited by the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>But to return to the matter in hand, which is the Conſideration of God's Diſhonour in that which is done. It is manifeſt that God is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured only by ſuch Actions, as are contrary to his Will; becauſe no Act which is either agreeable to his Will, by way of Command or Approbation; or allowed by his Will, by way of Permiſſion, can be diſhonourable to him; unleſs he can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to command, approve, or allow of his own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:192161:26"/>Diſhonour: From hence it follows, that God is not diſhonoured by any ſuch Acts, as are purely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their individual exiſtence; becauſe that, Diſhonour imports a Contradiction to ſuch an indifferency, and ſo deſtroyes it; For it cannot be indifferent to diſhonour God. But whether there be any ſuch individual Acts, as are abſolutely indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, is a diſputable point, which I may not here ſtand to examine.</p>
            <p>But, in general, every Act of Tranſgreſſion of the known Will of God, is a manifeſt derogation to his Glory, eſpecially that of his Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And eſpecially every preſumptuous, <hi>i. e.</hi> wilful Tranſgreſſion; for that imports a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, and his Authority; Therefore by this Rule, Chriſtians are eſpecially to be careful to abſtain from all preſumptuous Tranſgreſſions of God's Will, which way ſoever made known unto them, whether, by the written Word, or by the light of Reaſon, as before was ſaid.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe Actions are moſt apparently contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Will of God, which are evil in reſpect of the matter of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But it is no leſs manifeſt that ſome Actions, both which are indifferent, and which are good in reſpect of the Matter of them, may be evil in reſpect of the Manner, Circumſtances, and Ends of their Doing, as was ſaid before, and is too evident to need any proof; only this may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that as there are ſome kinds of Actions which cannot be made good, or indifferent by any Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance whatſoever, as to hate God, to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, or curſe him, to take his Name in vain, by falſe Swearing, &amp;c. which Actions certainly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:192161:27"/>are evil, not by any Arbitrary Law, or Will of God, but by their very Nature, and this Evil, ſuch, as no poſſible determination of God's Will, can, or could have acquitted them from; So are there ſome Acts (of the Soul eſpecially) which are ſo intrinſecally Good, as that they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Evil, by any Circumſtance or End that is conſiſtent with their Being, as to love God above all, to reverence him, to defire his Glory above all things, &amp;c: Yet I deny not, but that even in ſuch Actions (as they are now performed by men in the fleſh) there is ſome Imperfection; and that is an Evil, but not ſuch as denominates the Act to be ſo: except we will ſay, that it is impoſſible for the holieſt man that can be, to do any ſuch good Act, as is not a Sin. And then it were indeed a vain Queſtion to diſpute, Whether any ſingle Act can be indifferent; For if all ſuch Acts as have any, or the moſt goodneſs in them be Sins, it were a great abſurdity, to imagine that thoſe, which (being ſuppoſed indifferent,) have no Goodneſs in them, ſhould have no Evil; for then it would be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that one Evidence at leaſt of their not being Evil, ſhould be, becauſe they are not Good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (by this Concluſion) if they were Good, they would be Evil.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God is diſhonoured by ſuch Actions as have an appearance of Evil, and therefore by this Rule alſo, Chriſtians are to <hi>abſtain from all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Evil.</hi> This being the ground of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.22: as it is rendred in our own, and moſt other Tranſlations. For there is another poſſible Tranſlation of the words, which ſeems to be favor'd by the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tranſlator, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:192161:27"/>is accepted by ſome Interpreters, <hi>viz.</hi> from all kind or ſort of Evil: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ab omni ſpecie mali:</hi> But (beſides that this is a notable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of the ſenſe of the Precept) I doubt much whether the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> without Example elſe where in the New Teſtament, or the Septuagint, may be taken in ſuch a Philoſophical ſenſe: Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Chriſtians ought to abſtain not only from ſuch things as are really Evil, but alſo from all things that may give a Suſpition, or carry an appearance of Evil: As for Inſtance; we ought not only to abſtain from Pride and Vain-glory, from Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Deceit, Intemperance, and all manner of Unchaſtneſs; but alſo from all things that may give any ſuſpicion, or have any appearance of theſe Vices: for this Reaſon eſpecially, becauſe God is thereby liable to be diſhonoured.</p>
            <p>Now that God may be diſhonoured by ſuch Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as have an appearance of Evil in them, is evident: becauſe look how much appearance of Evil there is in an Action, ſo much appearance there is of Repugnancy to the Will of God, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much appearance of Contempt, or neglect of that Will of God in him that voluntarily doth it.</p>
            <p>Now this appearance of Evil in any Action, may be either to a man's <hi>ſelf only,</hi> or to <hi>others alſo,</hi> or to <hi>others only.</hi> For a Chriſtian to do any thing willingly, which hath a probable appearance to his own Conſcience, of being Evil, (though in truth it be not ſo in it's ſelf) is therefore a Sin, becauſe it implies a neglect, or want of reſpect to the Honour of God. Wherefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he alſo ſpeaks (as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:192161:28"/>he doth here) of Eating and Drinking, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Meats, gives this general Rule: <hi>He that doubteth is condemned,</hi> (viz. of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and therefore alſo, by St. <hi>John's</hi> Rule, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.21. by God alſo) <hi>if he Eat. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not of Faith, is Sin:</hi> i.e. whatſoever is done, without a juſt and reaſonable perſwaſion, of the lawfulneſs thereof, is Sin. Faith here being put for ſuch a Perſwaſion, is called Knowledge in the ſame Matter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7: A Chriſtian ought to be ſo tender and jealous, or zealous, of God's glory, as not willingly to do any thing that he doubts to be offenſive to him. God himſelf in the ſecond Commandment, is ſaid to be a jealous God, in reference to his own Glory; and therefore forbad the Jews (as is conceived) the making of any manner of Images of their own Invention, to a ſacred uſe; and eſpecially all manner of outward appearance of worſhipping them. And when we thus know him to be ſo jealous of his own glory, it concerns us to be as jealous of any thing that hath any reaſonable appearance of prejudice, or oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereto. He that much honours, or loves any Perſon, will be fearful of doing any thing willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which he ſuſpects may diſparage or diſpleaſe him; or that hath any appearance of diſhonour, or diſreſpect to him. And this (as I ſhall ſhew afterwards) is a ſpecial importance of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duty of fearing God, that is, a reverend, and awful fear of doing any thing, that may appear to be diſhonourable, or offenſive to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if this appearance or ſuſpition of Evil in an Action be not only ſuch, to the Actor himſelf, but to others alſo before whom it is to be done,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:192161:28"/>the doing of it will be the more diſhonourable to God, becauſe it is ſcandalous: he is doubly guilty, that Sinn's openly, becauſe he doth not only act, but teach a Sin; For all viſible or known Actions, are exemplary, in their own nature; though there be no ſuch Intention; yea, though there be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary deſire in the Actor, that is, that his doing ſhould not be imitated.</p>
            <p>But the main Queſtion is, What is to be done, in caſe this appearance of Evil in an Action, be only to others, and none at all to him that is to do it, but being to his certain knowledge, or perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a lawful Action? I Anſwer, that, if this be known, ſuch Actions are ordinarily for that time, and that reaſon, to be abſtained from, by the Rule of the Text. For ſuch was the particular Caſe of Inſtance, with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to whom the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things offered to Idols, was indifferent in it ſelf, ſo it were done without reſpect to the Idol; but is forbidden by the Apoſtle, only upon the account of Scandal: as appears, not only by the fore-going Verſes, but alſo by the words following my Text, <hi>Give none Offence</hi> (i.e. Scandal, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Stumbling) <hi>neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles; nor to the Church of God,</hi> i.e. neither to Chriſtians; The ſame Reaſon is urged to the ſame purpoſe more fully by the Appoſtle, in the 8. Chap. 8. v. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>God is diſhonoured by all manner of Scandal, whether it be taken only and not given, or given and not taken; but eſpecially by ſuch as is given, and taken; or by ſuch as is ſo given as is likely to be taken.</p>
            <p>And becauſe by this Text, we are required, as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:192161:29"/>much as in us lies, to prevent all manner of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, which may be occaſioned by our Actions, therefore ought we to take heed of all Scandal, that may be taken thereby; that is, to prevent it as far as we may.</p>
            <p>Now Scandal in the ordinary ſenſe, that is inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted upon by Practical Divines, is, Something done by any man, that is an occaſion of Sin in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I ſay <hi>ſomething,</hi> becauſe every thing that may be an occaſion of Sin in another, is not a Scandal in their ſenſe, though in Scripture-phraſe the word is ſometime ſo uſed: But Scandal is given, either by ſome known Sin, which a man doth, or ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to do before others, or by ſuch indifferent Actions, as a man doth before others, by whom he knows, or hath reaſon to ſuſpect, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Evil.</p>
            <p>To incourage others by Example (as well as otherwiſe) to the omitting of any Duty, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any Sin, is Scandal; From which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is to abſtain, in or upon a double Reſpect; Firſt, to the glory of God (according to the Rule o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 1. But it may be demanded, What is to be done in caſe the Action that hath this appearance of Evil to others, be not indifferent, but commanded either immediately by God, or by ſuch as have Authority under God, over a man? Whether is a Chriſtian in ſuch a Caſe, to omit that Action to avoid the ſcandal of his Brother?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, No ſurely. The reaſon is plain becauſe ſuch an omiſſion, is a ſin, and ſo a direct diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God in it ſelf. But one Sin is not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by another. As, a man is not to do Evil, that good may come of it; ſo, neither may he omit the doing of that Good, which is commanded, to prevent others doing of Evil. To omit a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Duty, is a preſent certain Evil; the Scandal that may be taken thereby, is but accidental, and contingent, though it be probable: Love both to God, and our ſelves requires, that, if God muſt be diſhonoured, it ſhould rather be by another, than by a man's ſelf: Beſides, the omiſſion of ſuch Actions, gives generally as great, or a greater Scandal to others, as it removes from ſome. Were the Caſe ſo, that a far greater Sin, and Diſhonour to God, were like to be done by occaſion of this Action, than that Omiſſion would be; yet were we not allowed, much leſs bound, thus to prevent it; Becauſe, there is no poſſible Conſideration which can licenſe, much leſs oblige, a man to Sin. The leaſt Sin is not to be done, to prevent the greateſt.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. But what if the Action be only good, and commendable, and not abſolutely commanded? For, ſuch Actions I think may be admitted (as well under the Goſpel, as in the Free-will Offerings, and voluntary Vows under the Law) without yielding the Doctrine of Supererogation: If ſuch Actions have an appearance of Evil, to others, whether are they to be omitted for that only Reaſon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If that Brother, who is ſuſpected to be ſcandalized by ſuch an Action, be truly weak, that is, uninſtructed, and not proud, wilful or obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and if that Scandal cannot be ſufficiently prevented, by inſtruction and due means of recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his judgment; I think, the Action ſhould for the preſent be omitted; Becauſe, all Actions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in their kind, are not alwaies neceſſary to be performed; according to the common Rule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. What if the Act that hath an appearance of Evil to Bretheren, which are truly weak, be barely lawful, and indifferent in it ſelf, neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nor yet good in its Nature or Kind, but yet neceſſary for the preſervation of a man's Life, Liberty, Eſtate or Credit, and cannot be omitted, without notable prejudice, and hazard to a man's ſelf in theſe Intereſts: Whether is a man bound to redeem the Scandal of his Brethren, with ſuch hazard or prejudice to himſelf or his Family? The Arguments producible for the affirmative in this Queſtion, are to be drawn, 1. From the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Diſhonour, which by the Sin of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (occaſioned by this Act of mine) will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. 2. From the Debt of Charity, to the Souls of our Neighbours. For, the glory of God, and the ſalvation of our Bretheren, ought to be preferred before any temporal Intereſt of our own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is certainly true, that the high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard which a man owes to theſe two things, will
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:192161:31"/>oblige a Chriſtian to do his indeavour, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the impeachment of them, and therefore bind him to uſe ſuch prudential means as he is able, to prevent the danger of Sin in another; which may be done, without forbearing the Action, which his neceſſity, or juſt intereſt doth ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Had the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for want of other Meat, been in danger to have ſtarved, or (by not eating this) any otherwiſe hazarded their Lives; I think they had not been abſolutely bound to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, by the Apoſtle's meaning in the Directions, which here he gives them: which do not ſuppoſe them under any ſuch Extremity, but only invited to the Meat. In that Caſe of Danger, I think, To have proteſted againſt all reſpect and honour to the Idol, might have acquitted them from the Scandal, and made their eating that Meat, in ſuch a caſe lawful; though the Apoſtle hath not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any ſuch Exception, becauſe there was no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it. And though there were an expreſs Apoſtolical Interdict againſt eating things offered to Idols,

If I were bound to redeem every accidental diſhonour to God, or hurt to my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's ſouls by the loſs of thoſe benefits which Gods Providence affords me, it would be ſcarce poſſible to enjoy them at all.</p>
            <p>But for a concluſion to this point of Scandal (the full and exact handling whereof agrees not with the model of a Sermon) I ſhall only adde a ſhort Inquiry into ſome of the reaſons or cauſes, whereby men are induced, to imitate others, in things againſt their own conſcience; the diſcovery whereof, will be uſeful, to reſolve ſome queſtions in this caſe. I ſhall name but two, which are both grounded upon the miſtake of the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
            <p>Herein I ſhall take leave to borrow ſomething both of ſenſe,
<note place="margin">D. <hi>H. H.</hi>
               </note> and words from a late reverend Author, who hath learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſed upon this Queſtion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One reaſon whereby people are ſometimes incouraged to do that which is againſt their own conſcience, is, from their own miſtake of the action, or intention, of him whom they imitate, thinking him to do or intend that which he doth not. Thus it might have happened in the caſe of things offered to Idols, <hi>i. e.</hi> that a Chriſtian eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch fleſh, without any Recognition of the Idol, or reſpect to the Sacrifice, might have been thought, by ſome that might have ſeen him eat ſuch meat, to have thereby acknowledged ſome reſpect to the Idol, or approved the Sacrifice.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:192161:32"/>And if the peril of the ſcandal depends upon ſuch a miſtake; that which is ſuſſicient to prevent, or remove that miſtake, or to clear the action, from ſuch a miſpriſion, (if it prove not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prevent the Scandal, which may be taken thereby, by one that will needs do a thing which he accounts to be evil, becauſe he believes I did the ſame, notwithſtanding my proteſtation to the contrary, yet) to clear me from the guilt of that ſcandal it will be ſufficient. For if my judgement, may be ſo much valued, as to be taken for a Warrant, for the doing of a doubtful action; my diſclaiming or diſavowing the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which another thinks me to do, ought in all reaſon to be of greater force, to diſſwade him from the doing of it, than his own bare imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of my practice, ſhould be to invite or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond reaſon whereby men are incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to imitate another man in a thing which is againſt their conſcience, and, as they think, againſt the Law of God, is, becauſe they think, that it is done by them whom they imitate, as much againſt their conſciences, and againſt the known will of God. For an act of preſumption, in one, is apt to incourage the like in a nother: And as this is the common caſe in ſuch ſcandals as are taken by known unqueſtionable Sins, wherein one man is emboldned by another's Example, in that which both acknowledg to be evil; ſo may it be in reputed evils, or the appearances thereof in indifferent things: That is, another man may be incouraged to do that which he accounts to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, by ſeeing me do the ſame thing, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192161:32"/>I alſo do know, or judg to be a ſin, and yet will adventure to do it: In this caſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, a ſufficient manifeſtation of my aſſurance, or full perſwaſion of the lawfulneſs of that which I do, and of my reſolution not to do it, if I thought it to be a ſin, will be enough to prevent the ſcandal, ſo farr at leaſt as it might be imputable to me.</p>
            <p>If the reaſon why another will dare to do a thing againſt his conſcience, be becauſe he thinks I do ſo too; that reaſon will be ſufficiently void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by my declaring that I neither do, nor dare ſo do. So that it will not be alwaies neceſſary for me to forbear that action, which to me is lawful, where I have opportunity to declare my judgment thereof, to prevent the ſcandal of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For if this declaration of my conſcience, be believed, it cuts off all appearance of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in me, and conſequently all ground of incouragement to the like preſumption in another whoſe conſcience agrees not with with mine. If it be not believed, that cannot be my fault, nor any conſequence thereof imputable to me: But though it be not abſolutely neceſſary to omit an action (which by appearance of evil may prove ſcandalous) in ſuch a caſe, where a man hath opportunity to do ſo much towards the prevention of the ſcandal, as the forementioned proteſtation may import. Yet by the inſtance of the Apoſtle in the Context, I conceive a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is ordinarily bound in charity, rather to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſuch actions, than to adventure the ſcandal of them, with the Antidote of his bare proteſtation: which as it might eaſily have been made in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:192161:33"/>
               <hi>Corinthians caſe,</hi> ſo might it as eaſily have been adviſed by the Apoſtle, if he had thought it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in ſuch an ordinary caſe, wherein there was no more neceſſity of the action.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſuffice for the firſt Propoſition, ſhewing how this general rule is to be obſerved in all our actions by way of caution, that is, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and diligent care that nothing be done by us to the prejudice of Gods glory: This (from the Context) ſeems to be the prime ſcope of the Apoſtle, in this Text: But becauſe this falls much ſhort of a Chriſtian's duty, therefore is it not to be taken for the intire, excluſive ſenſe of this general Canon. For it is not ſufficient that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done to the diſhonour of God, but juſt and meet it is alſo, that as much ſhould be done by us, as may be, to the honour and glory of God; that Chriſtians ſhould not content themſelves with a negative Religion, of not diſhonouring God; but that they ſhould make it their ſtudy, deſign, and ambition, to honour and glorifie him as much as they can: And therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Propoſition toward the full anſwer to the queſtion, How the glory of God may and ought to be ſought in all our doings, is this: Gods glory is to be deſigned by a general, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, devoting and dedicating of a mans ſelf, and all that he hath, and doth, to this End: By ſuch an entire, habitual, intentional, devotion, or come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of a mans ſelf, as a <hi>Holocauſt</hi> or whole-Offering to God, a man makes the glory of God the end of his being, and well being, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of whatſoever he doth in order to any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ends with reſpect to himſelf. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:192161:33"/>exhorts the Romans <hi>to preſent their bodies a living Sacrifice,

            <p>This Exhortation of the Apoſtle is excellently practiſed in that Prayer of the Liturgie after the Communion, in theſe devout words: <hi>Here we offer and preſent unto thee, ô Lord, our Souls and Bodies, to be a reaſonable, holy, and lively Sacrifice unto thee.</hi> As, when a man hath projected a main Deſign, and puts himſelfe upon the way of acting towards it, though he doth not in every act think of this end or explicitely direct every act thereunto; yet may he truly be ſaid to be acting towards it.</p>
            <p>When a man is going a journey, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the end of it, and the place whither he will go; though he doth not think of the place, or of the end, and deſign of his journey,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:192161:34"/>every ſtep or every refreſhment he takes in the way; yet may he be truly ſaid to intend that end, in every ſtep of the way, yea even in thoſe wherein he ſeems to go out of the way, only to to take in refreſhments to inable him to go on with the more cheerfulneſs: The common ends of thoſe Actions-which are named in the Text <hi>viz.</hi> eating and drinking were the preſervation of life, health, and ſtrength; and men are truly ſaid, to eat and drink for thoſe ends, although they do not think of thoſe things as oft as they eat. Thus may a man glorifie God in his ſleep when he doth not think of him; by deſigning that Reſt to his glory, as a means of refreſhing the body for his ſervice. This habitual devotion, of the whole man, to the glory of God, doth mainly conſiſt in two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In a ſincere deſire, and purpoſe of heart to obey the Will of God in all things, and that for this end, that thereby God may be glorified. For, as it is true (which before was ſaid) that God cannot be diſhonoured by any thing, which is not contrary to his Will; beeauſe every diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of God is a Sin, and every ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Will of God: So is it as manifeſt, that the greateſt honour and glory, that can be given to God conſiſts in the performance of his Will. For as God willeth nothing ſo much as his own glory, nor any thing but for it; ſo neither can any thing promote, or ſerve his glory, ſo much as what he willeth: nor any thing at all but what is at leaſt agreeable to his Will. But whereas there are ſome things approveable, and agreeable to his Will, which are not thereby commanded, it is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:192161:34"/>to be noted, that our duty of ſerving his glory, doth conſiſt eſpecially in doing thoſe things which are commanded; which <hi>Obedience,</hi> ſaith <hi>Samuel, is better than Sacrifice:</hi> Therefore I limit the extent of this habitual purpoſe, (as it is a duty required in the Text) to the matter of obedience; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that a man is bound to have the like ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral purpoſe for the doing of whatſoever may tend to the glory of God; For the Text doth not abſolutely require us to do whatſoever may be done, to the glory of God but whatſoever we ſhall do, to do all to the glory of God. Not that I intend to deny that a Chriſtian is ingaged in point of love, and gratitude, to promote and advance the glory of God, as much as morally he can: but that the Duty commanded in this general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept doth not expreſly extend ſo farr; which yet doth extend to all the actions, which a man actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doth or ſhould do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing wherein this habitual devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Gods glory doth conſiſt, is in an humble and cheerful willingneſs to ſubmit himſelf, and all that belongeth to him, to the appointment, and difpoſal of the Will of Gods providence; willing that God ſhould ſerve his own glory, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of any thing that is his: and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo willing to ſuffer any thing that the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God ſhall think fit to impoſe upon him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But thirdly; Men do then act to the glory of God moſt expreſly and perfectly, when in their particular actings they do actually and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly conſider, deſign, and intend this end; when they have it in their eye, minding and ſetting
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:192161:35"/>it before them as the higheſt end of their doings, and are therefore careful to do ſuch things, and in ſuch manner as may make moſt for that end; when a man acts all for this end, denying himſelf, and all other ends in compariſon of this; when he doth ſet aſide all other ends beſides this, acting pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſolely for Gods glory; or when he ſets all ends behind, or below this, and makes them ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to it.</p>
            <p>For when the Apoſtle teacheth us, to do all to the glory of God, his meaning is not, that this ſhould be the <hi>ſole</hi> End of all our Actions, but that it ſhould be the <hi>higheſt</hi> End, and that which ſhould Rule and Govern all other Ends; whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all other Ends ſhould be ſubſervient, or at leaſt-wiſe conſiſtent. For, God allow's us to love our ſelves, and requires us to love our Brethren; and therefore we may propound the good of our Selves, and our Brethren as ſome End of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. God himſelf hath propounded to us other ends than this, in our Well Doing, in his Promiſes of Reward. Something we may do for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Prince, and Countrey; yea, and for our own Honour too, ſo it be without Ambition and Vanity: This End of God's Honour or Glory, is not inconſiſtent with other honeſt Ends, much leſs repugnant, but Superior to them.</p>
            <p>And as it is not neceſſary a man ſhould have no other End but this, ſo neither is it neceſſary nor poſſible, that a man ſhould expreſly propoſe this End to himſelf by an actual Intention in every Act of his Life: yet, it is the part of a godly man, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to conſider and reflect upon this End, and to have regard unto it, eſpecially in all ſerious and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:192161:35"/>deliberate Actions, conſtantly in all Religious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and carefully in all doubtful Actions.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the Explication of this Doctrine, and am to proceed to matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation; which, though it be not neceſſary (in reſpect of the Evidence of the Doctrine, which is no other than an expreſs Sentence of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet may it be uſeful in order to the urging of the Practice, 1. To conſider how the ſame Duty is taught and required in ſome other Scriptures, 2. To ſhew the Equity, Reaſonableneſs, and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it, in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
            <p>Another Text where this Duty is expreſly taught is in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. <hi>That God in all things may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified through Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> This is that which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to aime at, that, <hi>God in all things may be Glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this ſhould be the Deſire and Scope of every Chriſtian, is to be noted from the firſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Lord's Prayer <hi>Hallowed be thy name</hi> that is, <hi>ſanctified</hi> (for I think the <hi>Latin</hi> word is better underſtood than the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) or, Glorified be thy name: Hereby we are taught, what ſhould be the firſt and chiefeſt defire of a Chriſtiau, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the honour and glory of God's name: and that which is or ought to be the firſt and chiefeſt of our Deſires, ought to be the higheſt end of all our Actions: That which men pray for, they ought in their practice to aime at, and labour for; elſe their prayers are hypocritical, as going out of fained lips.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore we are taught before all things, to pray that God's name may be hallowed, and glorified, this ought to be our ſtudy and practice: The ſame may be alſo inferred from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:192161:36"/>the following petitions, wherein we pray that Gods Kingdom may come, and his will be done on earth, as it is in Heaven. Gods name is glorified, when his Kingdom is advanced and eſtabliſhed, and his will is done; His glory is the prime object, and end of his Will: the holy Angels in Heaven do all things according to the Will of God, and to his glory: their only deſign, is to promote his glory: and we are to pray, and therefore to deſire, intend, and indeavour, as far as lies in us, that God may be glorified here on earth, by our ſelves, and others, as He is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing is taught us in the <hi>Doxology</hi> in the cloſe of that prayer, <hi>For thine is the kingdome the power [and the Glory,]</hi> that is, All glory is due to thee.</p>
            <p>Which may mind us of another Text of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> which together with a Precept for this duty, gives us the general reaſon, declaring the equity of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.1. <hi>Give unto the Lord, the glory, that is due unto his name.</hi> Therefore is Gods glory to be ſought in all our doings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this glory is due unto his Name; All glory is due to God; and that becauſe all things are from him and by him as Creator, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Thou art worthy, ô Lord, to receive glory and honour and power, for thou haſt created all things; and for thy pleaſure they are, and were created.</hi> Moſt juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it is, the author of any thing ſhould have the honour of his own work. This reaſon is expreſly given by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Glorifie God with your bodies and with your ſouls for they are Gods.</hi> God made all things for himſelf, that is for his own glory; and that which was His end, ought
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:192161:36"/>to be made ours too: elſe we ſhall diſappoint him, as far as lies in us. To ſtrengthen this Argument, we are to conſider; That not only our Being, is from God (which were enough to intitle him to the honour of all our doings) but alſo all our Actions, are dependent upon him; we do not only live and have our Being, from him, but in him we <hi>move</hi> too, we act all things by a conſtant ſupply of power from him: our meat, and drink, and every thing elſe that we uſe, are his gifts; ſo is alſo our ſtomach, appetite, and power of eating and drinking; therefore it is moſt unjuſt to uſe them to his Diſhonour, and moſt equitable to uſe them to his Glory. We have all from him <hi>jure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiario,</hi> and as <hi>Feudatories;</hi> with reſervation of ſervice, and honour to the <hi>donor,</hi> in the uſe of them. <hi>All rivers run into the Sea.</hi> All our ſtore is from the Fountain of Gods grace, and therefore ought in courſe of higheſt Reaſon, to be directed again into the Ocean of his glory, ſeeing we have nothing but from his bounty, and can do nothing but by his power; it is moſt unreaſonable we ſhould do any thing by his power, againſt his honour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But, ſecondly, It is not only a point of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Equity and Juſtice, to promote and ſerve his Honour in all our doings, becauſe we depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, not onely for the original of our Being, but alſo for, and in all our actions: but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us upon the ſame account, in point of gratitude, to honour him: A moſt ingrateful part it is, for us, that are ſo much obliged to him, for all that we have or have had, to do any thing willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or negligenly to his diſhonnor. And this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gratitude is increaſed, according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:192161:37"/>of Gods bounty and mercy, towards us a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But our duty of giving glory to God ariſeth moſt clearly from our Relations to him, and his to us. For he hath aſſumed to himſelf all titles of Relation which require the greateſt honour, and reſpect from their ſubjected Relatives: ſuch are the Titles of <hi>King, Lord, Father, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If we will demean our ſelves as becometh good Subjects to their <hi>King,</hi> as good Servants to their <hi>Lord,</hi> Children to their <hi>Father,</hi> Wives to their <hi>Husbands,</hi> then are we in all things to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to preſerve, and ſeek his honour, who by the aſſumption of thoſe Titles hath as well honoured us, as obliged us to honour him.</p>
            <p>It were eaſie to multiply reaſons to ſhew the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Equity and Obligation of this duty; but I ſhall add no more at this time, than the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of two ſpecial duties whith every man ow's to God, and whereby in Scripture the whole duty of man is frequently deſcribed; theſe are, <hi>to fear God,</hi> and <hi>to love him with all the heart, and, all the ſoul, and all the might.</hi> Neither of which duties (ſo often urged in Scripture) can be truly performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the obſervation of this rule, <hi>of giving God the glory of all we do;</hi> at leaſt in the firſt ſenſe, that is Without being carefull to preſerve the glory of God, and our reſpects thereto, in all that we do. For,</p>
            <p>To Fear God, as it is an act of Religion (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from that ſlaviſh fear, which is found in Devils and wicked men) is to reverence his Majeſtie, and to have an aweful reſpect to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:192161:38"/>in all things, being ever jealous and fearfull of doing any thing, that may diſhonour or diſpleaſe him,</p>
            <p>It is a fear of Reverence, and higheſt Honour, which is the duty of men to God,
<note place="margin">Rev. 14.7.</note> as the higheſt Majeſty: ſuch as is that fear which is expreſſed by the Attribute given by men to their Soveraign Princes, when they call them <hi>Dread Soveraigns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like regard to the glory of God, muſt needs be in all them that love God, with that Divine, holy, and peculiar love, which is due to God, as God, that is, <hi>with all the heart, and all the ſoul, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments.</hi> But this is not the entire meaning of the words, but alſo that the right keeping of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is only that, which proceeds from love to God; ſo that, were it poſſible for a man to keep all the Commandments, without any other love, than that which men have for themſelves, (which muſt needs be impoſſible, becauſe to love God is not only <hi>one,</hi> but the <hi>chief</hi> of the Commandments) he could not truly pretend to have kept any of them; at leaſt not in the Goſpel-ſenſe, that is, in <hi>Spirit and truth.</hi> To ſerve God in ſpirit, and truth (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law of the Goſpel, and which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be a main part of that <hi>Reformation</hi> under the Goſpel which the Author to the Hebrews mentions,) is, not only to ſerve him in the doing of ſuch things as are good in themſelves, and, as <hi>ſuch,</hi> diſtinguiſhable from the Ceremonial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Law; but alſo to ſerve him in love for his own ſake, that is, for his honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This is it, which diſtinguiſheth the good
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:192161:39"/>actions, of carnal and unregenerate men, from thoſe, of the truly faithfull. It is manifeſt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that not only carnal Chriſtians, but the moſt barbarous Infidels, do many actions agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law of God; but, in as much as no ſuch perſon, makes God the end of his actions, thoſe actions are not ſincerely good, nor ſo much as acts of Obedience to God, who requires to be obeyed in Love.</p>
            <p>Now as theſe two common Duties, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the whole ſervice of God, cannot be truly performed, without the obſervation of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral precept in the Text; ſo, much leſs can that, which is nothing elſe but the perfection of theſe, that is, the duty of holy Zeal for God. For god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zeal can have no other proper deſign, than the glory of God. But I forbear to inſiſt upon this, or to add any other reaſons for the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the point, becauſe I ſhall have occaſion, by way of motive, to mention the ſame again, with others, in the practical Application whereto I am now to proceed.</p>
            <p>THe firſt general uſe which is to be made of all Pradical Doctrines (ſuch as this is) is,

               </gap> is the proper part of every mans Conſcience, to reflect upon it ſelf, by way of Examination, whether that duty be, or hath been obſerved, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Chriſtian practice.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:192161:39"/>
            <p>Let every one of us conſider, and examine, whether we have obſerved this rule or no in all our doings. And for the aſſiſtance of any Conſcience, that may be perſwaded to ſuch a faithful Application, I ſhall (from the premiſſes already laid down) draw up the <hi>Interrogatories,</hi> which each man ſhould charge upon himſelf to Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether haſt thou had any ſuch regard to the glory of God, as to take heed of any doing thing, which thou knoweſt to be contrary thereunto? Haſt thou been careful to act nothing diſagreeable to his known Will? Haſt thou been ſo jealous and tender of his honour, as not willingly, or needleſly to do any thing which had any appearance of evil, to thy ſelf or to others, who were like to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized thereby? Haſt thou conſecrated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted thy whole ſelf, and all the Intereſts of thy life, in the deſire and deſigne of thy heart, to God, and his glory? Haſt thou by a general propoſition, ſet God for the end of all thy doings? Haſt thou frequently minded, conſidered, and thought of, the glory of God in thy doings; and made it the rule, by which thou haſt ordered the matter and manner of them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe Interrogatories</hi> being all drawn out of the main parts of that Explication of this Rule, which hath been premiſed, are neceſſary to be put upon the <hi>Examination,</hi> by every <hi>Conſcience</hi> that (acknowledging this duty) would rightly cenſure it ſelf, in reference to the practice thereof; the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue</hi> of ſuch an Examination, ſincerely made, may be of good effect to the foul, whatever the anſwer of the Conſcience ſhould prove to be. For, either it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:192161:40"/>will tend to the Comfort of the Conſcience, which ſhall be able before God to teſtifie its own perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe things, though with weakneſs and imperfection, or it will be uſeful, towards a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect of Humiliation, and Repentance, upon the Conviction of the neglect of ſo main a duty: There can be no greater Comfort to the ſoul of a Chriſtian, than that which duly ariſeth, from the practice of thoſe premiſes: becauſe there can be no greater evidence of Sincerity in the heart, than that of ſuch a practice. For this (if any thing) is, to be really and truly godly, upright and faithful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Such a one is the man after God's own heart; Who is or can be, a more faithful ſervant than he that aimes at his maſters honour and ſervice in all that he doth? I may therefore with greateſt confidence ſay to ſuch a ſoul, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant, enter thou into thy Maſter's joy.</hi> The utmoſt of ſpiritual Joy, and Conſolation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to that ſoul; which certainly hath as high an Intereſt in Gods favour, as God hath in his heart. There can be no higher argument or evidence of the fear, and love of God than this; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no better title to all thoſe promiſes, that are made to them that love or fear God. Oh that we were all able to apply this comfort to our own ſouls! Which is to be feared, can be done but by a very few.</p>
            <p>I muſt therefore for an impartial application of this point proceed to ſuch matter of Reprehenſion as is due to ſeveral ſorts of perſons for the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of this duty. Which Reproof muſt needs fall moſt heavy upon them, who in ſtead of acting all to the glory of God, do act direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:192161:40"/>contrary to this end. It is too notorious to be denied, that moſt of the Affections, Thoughts, Words, and Actions of many men, are directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, to the Glory of God. I ſpeak of ſuch, as not only (by infirmity) do ſometimes act contrary to the glory of God, but do make it their ſtudy, work, and main buſineſs, to diſhonour him. As if the glory of God were the object of their envy; and that they were reſolved to prejudice it, as much as in them lies, and that, as near as they can, He ſhould have no glory by them. Herein are wicked men, perfect children of the Devil, whoſe whole buſineſs it is to procure the diſhonour of God, and to oppoſe the glory which he ſhould have from men. And though it be ſcarce credible, that there are any men, which have any ſuch malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous defign, againſt God; yet the practice of many men is as ſubſervient to this Diabolical deſign, as if they were profeſſed Confederates, and had indeed combined with the Devil to this end.</p>
            <p>It matters little to the Credit of this Nation that ſuch prodigious expreſſions of open blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and defiance to God, as are ſaid, to be uſed by the
<note n="*" place="margin">Je renie Dieu maugre dedieu.</note> 
               <hi>Italian</hi> and
<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>French</hi> Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians, are not heard amongſt us; ſo long as the plain ſenſe of them, is as loudly proclaimed in the lives; and actions, of our Countrimen, as it is in any of theirs.</p>
            <p>To deny God, obſtinately cuſtomarily, induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, in our works, or to act in deſpite of him, and all his Commands, is nothing leſs to him (but perhaps ſomething more) than in bare words
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:192161:41"/>of a prophane courſe, ſo to blaſpheme him as they are ſaid to do.</p>
            <p>Others there are whoſe doings are not ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly contrary to the glory of God, yet have they no reſpect to it in any thing they do. They are no ſuch abſolute enemies to God, and his glory, as thoſe elder ſons of Belial, nor are they any true friends to him; but do as much neglect the glory of God, as others do oppoſe it: ſo far from doing all to the glory of God, that they do nothing at all to this end. They have no ſuch deſign, in any thing they do; they have other ends, in all that they do; and for This it is the leaſt of their care, it never enters into their thoughts: They never mind what becomes of Gods glory, ſo their own ends be ſerved. Oh how do the greateſt number of men ſlight, vilifie, and neglect, this great Deſign of the Creator, and his Whole Creation? How little are they moved with it at any time? There is no carnal or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end, ſo petty, and inconſiderable, that ſignifies ſo little to them, as this doth; or that will not move them much more, than any conſideration of this end. What a deal of ſtudy, and pains, will men take for other ends? how little will they do for this? what a cold Argument it is, to tell men, Such a courſe, or ſuch a practice, tends to the glory of God, and for that end is to be imbraced? Tell them of a courſe that will bring honour, profit, or pleaſure to themſelves in this world you move them to ſome purpoſe; But, if you talk of nothing, but the Glory of God, they regard you not. Yea ſo far are moſt people from reſpecting the glory of God, in all their actions: that they neglect it in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:192161:41"/>actions which they perform not ſo much for this, as for other ends, which reſpect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as their Reputation and Credit, or at beſt the Peace of their Conſceinces which will not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be maintained, with a totall neglect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have ſpoken of ſuch perſons as do not, ſo much as pretend to the glory of God, in any thing they do,</p>
            <p>But there are that pretend much to this end, who intend nothing leſs; Pretend to ſeek and aime at nothing ſo much as Gods glory, when their only ends are, no other than carnal, and worldly intereſts, as of Gain, Power, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, popular applauſe, and preferment amongſt men.
<note place="margin">2 King. 10.16</note> Juſt as <hi>Jehu</hi> did when he ſaid, <hi>Come ſee my zeal for the Lord;</hi> whiles he ſought nothing ſo much as his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Power and Dominion. <hi>Wretched duſt and aſhes,</hi> that we ſhould not tremble to make ſo bold, with the moſt ſacred thing in the world <hi>(the glory of God)</hi> as to make it a ſtale, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy, to the ſervice of our own baſe luſt, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
            <p>But yet is not this altogether ſo abominable, as is the practice of them, that have had the face to pretend this ſame ſacred End, in ſuch actions as are moſt directly oppoſite thereunto: To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the glory of God, as the end of ſuch doings, which are as highly diſhonorable to his name, as the moſt malicious Enemy thereof, <hi>Satan</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, could ſuggeſt, as diametrically oppoſite to the will and honour of God, as the <hi>Zenith</hi> of the higheſt Heavens, is to the <hi>Nadir</hi> of the loweſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:192161:42"/>Hell. What greater wickedneſs can be acted, than that which hath been done in Gods name, and under a pretence of his glory? Who knows not that this hath been the plea of the very worſt of <hi>Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Sacrilegious</hi> perſons, <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, Rebells, Traitors, Murtherers,</hi> and all ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and factious perſons? And that, under the pretence, of advancing the Kingdome and glory of God, all manner of power, Civil and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical together with all law, equity, peace, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and right, hath been violently oppoſed? Yea &amp; (which is the moſt prodigious riddle of impietie that ever was heard of) the ſacred <hi>Articles of Chriſtian Faith,</hi> all ordinances of Religion and all ſolemn Means, Methods, and Rites of worſhipping God, all maintenance and Miniſtery of the holy Goſpel, have been zealouſly oppoſed, upon no other pretence, than the Glory of God. As the Infidel <hi>Jewes</hi> would have perſwaded the blind man in the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Joh. 9.24.</note> to give praiſe to <hi>God,</hi> by denying of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So, have men been perſwaded to give glory to God, by prophaning his Houſe, robbing his Altar, perſecuting his ſervants; nay, what if I ſhould ſay, by blaſpheming his Name?</p>
            <p>To ſay, That God may be blaſphemed, to the honour of his name, and that the groſſeſt acts of moral impiety, ſuch as prophane ſwearing, curſing, and all kind of uncleanneſs, riot, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may be profeſſedly done to the Glory of Gods free grace, is no more than hath been own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and aſſerted, by our <hi>Ranters,</hi> and <hi>Libertines:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to mention the horrid opinions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Gods being the cauſe of Sin, by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:192161:42"/>effectually and irreſiſtibly moving and determining the wills of men to the worſt of ſins; by an efficacious decree firſt ordaining the ſin, and then the eternal puniſhment thereof in hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all to the glory of God in his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Dominion and Juſtice. I hope, the men who have held forth ſuch expreſſions, have not meant ſo ill as their words ſeem to ſignifie, to common ſenſe. And therefore, it is not my intention to parallel them to the forementioned ranks of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane mockers of God and his Glory: Only, I heartily wiſh ſuch Teachers, would ſadly conſider, whether thoſe Doctrines be like to produce any ſuch glorious conceptions of God in the minds of other men, as they pretend they do in theirs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But my Reprehenſion cannot without partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, determine in ſuch a liſt of perſons, as I have hitherto deſcribed; becauſe it may, moſt juſtly, be extended to a better ſort of Chriſtians, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the beſt, which are to be found amongſt us. For doubtleſs, We are all to blame in that we have ſo little regarded the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> in the general courſe of our thoughts, words, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; In that we have ſought our ſelves and our own ends ſo much, and Gods glory ſo little. How few of us, can ſay, but that other ends have been more regarded by us, than this? How ſeldome, and how ſlightly, do we mind this end? how little care have we to ſecure it, or zeal to procure it? Were this indeed our chief end, we would be more careful of our waies; we would not be ſo looſe, ſo carnal, vain and worldly, in our common Actions; ſo negligent, cold, lazy and ſleight in our Religious Actions.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:192161:43"/>Were the glory of God more pretious to us, other ends would not be ſo much over-ſought by us. We have all cauſe to be humbled before the Lord, for this general ſin of neglecting his glory; hath the Lord deſerved ſo to be ſleighted by us? nay, Which of us can ſay, but he hath infinitely deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we ſhould have had all the zeal that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for his Glory? Should he regard us, and our welfare, no more, than we do him, and his glory, what would become of us? With what face do we expect to appear before this glorious God, whom we have ſo much ſleighted? How can we pretend we love him with all our hearts, and all our might, whiles we have no more Affection, for that which we know to be his only Intereſt? and that which is ſo infinitely dear to him, is ſo little valued by us? How can we expect to be eternally glorified by him, and with him, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his Glory no more than we have done? Oh let us take the ſhame of this unkind and ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full neglect upon our ſelves.</p>
            <p>And let me cloſe the Application of this point with a preſſed Exhortation, of all that profeſs to love and fear the Lord, from henceforth to be more mindful of this Rule in all their doings: To which purpoſe (conſidering the generality of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition thereunto, which hath been already declared by way of Reprehenſion) I cannot think it needleſs to re-inforce the Exhortation, by ſome addition of Motives, and Arguments to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before alledged.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As, to know the end of his actions, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth a man from a beaſt; ſo to chuſe and propoſe a good end, diſtinguiſheth a good man
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:192161:43"/>from a bad. As men and reaſonable creatures, we are to have ſome end in all our doings; and, as godly men, the glory of God ought to be our chief end, to which all others are to be ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, and therefore ought we not to have any end inconſiſtent with this.</p>
            <p>Nothing ſo much dignifies an Action as the end of it, and no end ſo worthy as this, by which all actions are ſanctified; even the commoneſt actions while they are (though remotely) truly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely deſigned to this end, are <hi>hallowed;</hi> and without it, the moſt Religious action is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein conſiſts the form, eſſence, and ſpirit of Religion, properly ſo called. Godlineſs, both name and thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is nothing elſe, but a Religious affection to God, expreſſed by ſuch acts, as are agreeable to his will and honour, and done for this end, becauſe they are ſo, he that counts or calls any thing Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which hath not this end, (that is, which hath not God for its end) doth not underſtand what he ſaith.</p>
            <p>This alſo is true <hi>Holineſs</hi> in the moſt diſtinct and proper notion, which imports a ſeparation from the world, with a devoting of a thing to the ſacred Majeſty of God. Look how much a man is ſequeſtred from ſin, and from the world, and devoted to God, and his glory; ſo much Holineſs is there in him. Holineſs is commonly diſtinguiſhed into <hi>inherent</hi> and <hi>relative;</hi> but, to ſpeak ſtrictly, all holineſs in a creature, is relative; importing a ſingular conſignation unto God. Not, but that there is ſuch an inherent quality, as that which is called Holineſs, in all true Saints; but becauſe the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:192161:44"/>reaſon of the name, and the formality of the thing conſiſts in the reference of this quality to God, as the rule and end of it. That kind of holineſs in men, which is commonly called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, or practical, conſiſting in diſpoſitions, habits, or acts, is ſuch only in reference to God and his glory, which is the object or end of them. And therefore no ſuch vertuous Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, or Acts, as have not this reference, principle and end, have any thing of the nature of true holineſs in them. For this reaſon, moral vertues and good actions, of meer hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, amount not to the nature of holineſs. A relative holineſs may be, (and is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) attributed to other things, both natural, and artificiall; but no creature is ſo truly capable thereof as Man; becauſe he is not only capable, of being ſeparated, and conſecrated, to the ſervice of God, by a power, or will, Extrinſecal to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as other things are; but by a proper deſign, dedication, and devotion, of his own. Man by by nature is a <hi>Sacred Creature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ovid. Sanctius his annimal.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a kind of natural Conſecration to God, from that image of the Creator which is ſtamped upon him in the Indowment of Reaſon,
<note place="margin">Ratio res Dei, Tertul.</note> which the Father truly calls a <hi>Divine thing:</hi> So, Man may be called the <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the viſible world, out of all the Tribes of living Creatures, elected, qualified, and appointed to celebrate the glory of God; nor only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but as it were in the name of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of this lower world.</p>
            <p>This was his office and dignity according to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:192161:44"/>the prime intention of his Creation. But, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, being now, by original and perſonal ſin, profaned, &amp; become unworthy of, indiſpoſed and unable to perform this Prieſtly Office; God hath been pleaſed to ordain a new Conſecration of Man unto this Prieſthood, by the grace of a new Sanctification in Chriſt, effected by the Spirit of God, which is <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the Holy one,</hi> 1 John 2.20.27. given to all true Chriſtians, whereby they are made <hi>a holy Prieſthood to offer up ſpiritual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is the true nature of holineſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as Saints, we are eſpecially bound to the obſervation of this Rule:
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.2.</note> And Saints we are <hi>by Calling,</hi> as many as profeſs our ſelves to be Chriſtians:</p>
            <p>For to profeſs Chriſtianity, is to profeſs a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the prophane world, and the fleſh, and to be devoted unto God, the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, according to the expreſs form of our Baptiſm. And that we are obliged to this duty as Chriſtians, may further be inferred both from the Example, and Precepts of Chriſt, which as Chriſtians we are ingaged to follow. And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is ſo much a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as he is conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Example,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or, to ſpeak in the Apoſtle's phraſe, as <hi>Chriſt is formed in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we look upon the Example of Chriſt, we ſhall find that the main deſign of his whole life, in all that he did, ſaid, or ſuffered, was the Glory of his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. <hi>I have glorified thee on Earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do;

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:192161:45"/>that it may be ſuch, as may ſhew a due reſpect to his Honour?</p>
            <p>But this is the caſe of all men: we are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the preſence of God, we think, ſpeak, and act all before God; and therefore ought to have a conſtant reſpect to his glory, if we have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to himſelf: For he that reſpects not the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, reſpects not God at all. Men have other Intereſts wherein they may be ſerved by their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants or Friends, beſides their honour; as pleaſure, and profit. Much may be done, to ſerve an earthly <hi>Lord</hi> in his <hi>pleaſure,</hi> or <hi>profit,</hi> which is againſt his honour.</p>
            <p>But the only intereſt that God hath, is his <hi>Honour;</hi> he is incapable of any Profit: therefore <hi>when we have done all we can, we are unprofitable ſervants</hi> to him. Profit our ſelves we may (as we ſhall hear, and no way ſo much, as by obſerving the duty of the Text) but Him we cannot profit. And though we may pleaſe him, yet that can be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than by honouring or glorifying him. Where there is a zealous and faithful affection, it will move a man to promote the honour of the perſon affected, in his abſence, and in ſuch things as he is never like to know of: And therefore, if we loved God, we would ſeek his glory, though he ſhould take no notice of it. But to neglect this in his preſence, and under his ſpecial obſervation, argues not only want of love but many degrees of contempt. On the other ſide, it is not only an ingagement, but an incouragement, to direct our doings to God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s glory, becauſe we know he ſeeth and obſerveth what reſpect we have to him, and is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it. Which brings me to the laſt motive that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:192161:46"/>I ſhall mention; and that is to be drawn from the benefit of this practice to a mans ſelf: Such ſhould be the diſpoſition of a Chriſtian, that he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of Gods glory, though it were without any benefit to himſelf; nay, though it were by his own annihilation or deſtruction: Such was the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 32.32. Rom. 9.3.</note> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in thoſe heroical expreſſions of higheſt piety; wherein they wiſhed to loſe their part in their everlaſting injoyments of God's favour, rather than he ſhould want the Glory of his Mercy in the multitude of their Bretheren: For, though I think it poſſible, they might alſo in their wiſhes prefer the good of their bretheren, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, before their own ſingle felicities: yet, becauſe, by my Text, I know it was their duty, even in ſuch a choice, to reſpect <hi>God's glory</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, therefore I conclude they did ſo. And though I would not intimate any thing to the abatement of their praiſe in thoſe expreſſions; yet do I think it, no extrem hard choice to a religious mind, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the glory of God, before any poſſible felicity of his own; becauſe he may preferr it before his Being, which he knowes to be neceſſary to ſuch a poſſibility.

               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:192161:46"/>and (if it could be) his Being withal, upon ſuch a condition, I think might be the deliberate choice, of a devout ſoul. But becauſe God hath not put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſuch choice, we need not ſolicit our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, with any ſuch imaginary ſuppoſition. And though the Rule of the Text, be indeed a perfect Rule of Self-denial, juſtly underſtood; yet ſuch is the goodneſſe of God, that he will <hi>reward</hi> the practice of it: and becauſe he hath promiſed ſo to do, it can be no part of our duty, to ſet aſide all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the benefit of our duty, becauſe ſo to doe would be to fruſtrate one end of his promiſes, and to ſleight his bounty, which would be a plain oppoſition to his Glory, which we pretend to ſeek.</p>
            <p>They are therefore no ſuch friends to God's glory as they pretend, that ſay; Men ought not to reſpect their own benefit, in any ſervice that they do to God.</p>
            <p>Beſides the preſent comfort of a mans own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, bearing witneſs of his integrity, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of heart to God-ward, (whereof this conſtant ſeeking of his glory, is the moſt infallible evidence);
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.30.</note> the Lord hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he will honour them that honour him, and hath provided a Crown of glory, for them that glorifie him: And certainly the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of glory hereafter will be anſwerable to the degrees of zeal and Induſtry that men had here, to glorifie God: the more a man ſeeks God's glory, the greater ſhall be his own glory; whereas he that acts not for God, cannot in reaſon expect any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from him, for any thing that he doth, how good, or how much ſoever it be.</p>
            <p>The want of this end, or preferring any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, fruſtrates a man of the heavenly reward.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:192161:47"/>I ſay, <hi>the heavenly;</hi> becauſe ſome temporal reward may be received, for well doing, by him that hath no ſuch ſincere reſpect to Gods glory.

<note place="margin">2 King. 10.30.</note> as <hi>Jehu</hi> had.

            </p>
            <p>Before I conclude my diſcourſe upon this point (which I have already declared to be the moſt fundamental Canon of Chriſtian Religion); I ſhall add to what hath been hitherto ſpoken concerning it, 1. Some ſpecial Notes or Characters, whereby it may be diſcerned, whether a man walks accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this rule, or no. 2. Some particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections uſeful to be obſerved, in order to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral practice thereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt I ſhall propound ſome proper ſignes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man may be able to judg whether he hath any ſuch religious affection, to the glory of God, as this duty requireth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He that hath an intire loyall heart, to God and his glory, will value Gods intereſt above hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> own, in every thing that he hath, or doth: This is a generall note of integrity to God-ward. If the heart be truly faithfull, there will be no intereſt of his own, ſo precious to him, as the intereſt of God. Men in the fleſh have many intereſts, ends, and projects, which they ſeek in order to the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their various appetites; as bodily life, eaſe, ſafety, liberty, wealth, health, honour and pleaſure.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:192161:47"/>Now it is the part, and property of a godly man, to conſider, that as God hath a general intereſt in every thing that is, or is done, in the world; ſo he hath a more ſpecial intereſt in him, and all that belongs to him; in reſpect of the propriety which he hath in him, and his ſpecial and peculiar ingagement to him, above other men.</p>
            <p>The intereſt that God hath in the world, and all things that belong to it, is univerſal, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent, infinitely above any intereſt that a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can have in any thing, whereto he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the moſt abſolute propriety. <hi>The Earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof.</hi> Ezek. 16.17. &amp;c. <hi>Thou haſt taken thy fair Jewels of my Gold, and of my Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; which I had given thee, and madeſt to thy ſelf images of men, and did'ſt commit whoredom with them. And took' thy broydered garments, and coverd'ſt them, and thou haſt ſet mine oyle, and mine incenſe before them; my meat alſo which I gave thee, fine flower, and oyle, and hony, wherewith I fed thee, thou haſt even ſet it before them, for a ſweet ſavour— Moreover thou haſt taken thy ſons and thy daughters, whom thou haſt born unto me, and theſe haſt thou ſacrificed unto them to be devoured.</hi> No mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, meat, garments, children, are ſo much his own, as they are God's. God's gifts they are all, and tis he that gives us an intereſt in them, but doth not deſtroy or evacuate his own. For God's deed of gift to the creature, doth not alienate the propriety, as man's doth; he doth never give away any thing, from himſelf, and therefore may ſtill command, what ever he hath given; and take it away again, with as much juſtice, as he gave it with mercy: What ever we have, we
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:192161:48"/>hold by title of <hi>frank Almoign,</hi> as the Lawyers ſpeak, and as <hi>uſu-fructuaries</hi> rather than proprietors.</p>
            <p>But beſides this common intereſt of God's, as the true and ſoveraign proprietor of all things, he hath a ſpecial intereſt in his own people, and in all that is theirs, as his peculiar ſervants: And this is not only to be acknowledg'd by them, but preferred before any intereſt of their own; and ſo will be, by every faithful ſervant. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will be content at any time, to reſign and depart from, neglect and diſregard, his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to promote, ſalve or ſecure, the intereſt of God's glory. Agodly man looks upon all that he owns, as God's, more than his; and therefore will be ready to uſe it, or leave it, lay it down, or lay it out, according to the will of God, and as may make moſt for his glory.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to this firſt general Note of obſerving this rule, is the practice of Self-denial, and Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of carnal luſts. Look how much of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial is found in any man, ſo it be ſincere (and not partial, denying himſelf in one thing, to ſerve himſelf in an other) ſo much of Religion towards God. For the greateſt Let, that men have from ſeeking God's glory, is ſelf-love: Carnal ſelf-love (I mean), or inordinate love of the carnal Self. For there is an innocent kind of ſelf-love founded in the law of nature, and ſuppoſed in all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of reward, to the obedience of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, as they are propounded for motives thereunto. Whiles God doth invite or incourage us to ſeek, and ſerve him, with promiſes of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our ſelves, by ſo doing, he muſt needs allow us ſome meaſures of love for our ſelves, elſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:192161:48"/>ſuch arguments would be no juſt motives to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but temptations to ſin, if all ſelf-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were ſo. Such motives could have <hi>no</hi> effect at all upon our wills, if we <hi>did</hi> not love our ſelves; nor any <hi>good</hi> effect, if we <hi>might</hi> not.</p>
            <p>Indeed, this natural ſelf love is ſo far from being a ſin, or breach of any Commandment, that it is the rule, and meaſure, of the great Commandment of Charity: expreſſed in thoſe two general, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent precepts, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour, as thy ſelf;</hi> And, <hi>What ſoever you would that men ſhould do unto you, do you unto them likewiſe.</hi> And though this Self-love be no where commanded, in expreſs terms, becauſe it needed not; yet the immediate effects, and inſtances of it are: As, when we are commanded to <hi>lay up for our ſelves treaſures in Heaven;</hi> to <hi>ſeek thoſe things which are above;</hi> to <hi>work out our own ſalvation with fear, and trembling;</hi> to <hi>uſe all diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But to return from this Digreſſion: Though it be manifeſt by the premiſed diſcourſe, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, by the direct light and law of nature, That there is a kind of ſelf-love which is more than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and conſequently, which can be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to that love of God, which is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the ſeeking of his glory, but may be ſubordinate, and ſubſervient thereunto; Yet that which is commonly underſtood by the name of ſelf-love is indeed the greateſt Enemie to the love of God: And the ſeeking our Selves inordinately is in truth the only thing that diverts us from the ſeeking of God, and his Glory. For, though a man may be turn'd aſide from his duty of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:192161:49"/>to God, by an irregular love, or fear of men. And though the pleaſing of men be an ordinary temptation to that which is diſpleaſing to God, yet, both that love, and fear of men, is reducible to ſelf-love as its principle and end. And this vitious Self-love though it be not the only thing which is underſtood by the name of Original ſin yet may it fitly enough be ſo called: in as much as upon ſtrict examination, it may be found to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the root, and original of all actual ſin, both of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and commiſſion: So that in what degree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> man is able to overcome this Lett, in ſuch degre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he is free and prepared to ſeek and ſerve the glor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of God. And he that is throughly willing, and able to deny himſelf, ſhall find nothing to lett him from ſerving of God.</p>
            <p>And yet ſo true it is, that whiles God wills us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> have ſuch an univerſal reſpect to his glory, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> expreſſed in this Rule, he doth not inhibit us the love of our ſelvs, that, upon a right underſtanding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the matter, it will be evident to a true believer. That he loves himſelf beſt, that loves God better. And this is moſt manifeſt upon the account of that finall happineſs, which is promiſed in the life to come, to them that love God. And, becauſe this is the chief and higheſt intereſt of a believer, it is certain that the beſt way to ſecure, and promote a man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> own intereſt, is to ſecure the Intereſt of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with the utmoſt of fide lity and holy zeal.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He that hath ſuch a true reſpect to Gods glory as this Text requires, will be grieved at, and for, the diſhonour of God; whether it be done by himſelf, or by others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As oft as his conſcience ſhall charge him
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:192161:49"/>with the doing of any thing contrary to the glory of God, he will be heartily grieved for it: And this is that which the Apoſtle calls <hi>Godly ſorrow,</hi> or <hi>ſorrow according to God:</hi> namely that only, whereby a man is ſorry for the diſpleaſing, or diſhonouring of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> is the Scripture-name for that which the Schools call <hi>Contrition,</hi> and is the proper effect, and therefore an infallible ſigne of love to God. A carnal man, and he that is worſe, a reprobate, and a devil, may be grieved for ſin, as it is the cauſe of Miſchief or miſery to himſelf; but not at all, as it is diſhonourable and offenſive to God. The carnall man's ſorrow, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for his ſin, is not ſo much, nay not at all indeed for the ſin, as ſuch; but for the events, and conſequences thereof, which he either feels or fears. And yet this is the only ſorrow which the School Doctors underſtand by the term of <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which ſome of them maintain to be ſufficient to Salvation, if it be joyned with Abſolution, or but the Vote of it: By which Doctrine, all neceſſity of love to God, or reſpect to his glory is perfectly excluded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But whoſoever hath a true reſpect to the glory of God, will not only be grieved for his own ſinnes, but alſo for the ſins of others, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame account; becauſe thereby God is diſhonoured. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 136. <hi>Rivers of tears run down mine eyes, becauſe they keep not thy Law,</hi> and v. 158. <hi>I beheld the tranſgreſſors, and was grieved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they kept not thy word.</hi> Other mens ſins were his ſorrows: He was more grieved for other mens ſins, than they were for their own. <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom</hi> was vexed with the filthy converſation of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:192161:50"/>wicked, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. A faithfull ſervant, or well diſpoſed Son, cannot indure to ſee, and hear his Maſter or Father diſhonoured. Nor will any true friend, be unconcern'd in the reproach of his friend. He therefore that hath the patience to ſtand by, and hear or ſee the Name of God blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, or his holy Will violated, without any ſentiments of diſpleaſure, can neither be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, child, nor friend of God: And he that hath any intire affection to the glory of God, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and indeavour, as much as in him lies to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the impeachment thereof, by others as well as by himſelf: and that not only by removing of ſcandal (as in the caſe of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of) but by all the offices of ſpiritual charity, <hi>viz.</hi> by admoniſhing, reproving, exhorting, counſelling, &amp;c. and by performing all the duties of his place, towards ſuch as relate unto him. He that truly loves God, will deſire as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rivals, and make as many friends for God as he is able.</p>

If God be glorified in any thing that is his, he will rejoyce in it more than at the improvement thereof to any advantage of his own. He will not be contented only, but glad God is glorified though no other end of his be ſerved, nor benefit ariſeth to himſelf: yea, though it be with the croſſing of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; though he ſuffers much by a good action, yet his heart is comforted, and abundantly ſatisfied in the Glory of God.</p>

            <p n="4">4. An other ſign of a mans walking by this rule, is, when he is careful of his Actions, as well in Secret, as in Publick. For a man to be as religious and conſciencious, in ſecret, where he can have no other witneſs, but God, and his own conſcience; as he is, or would ſeem to be, in or before, the greateſt company of men: is at leaſt a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable argument, and evidence of a pure and pious intention, and of a ſincere reſpect to the glory of God. Becauſe, ſo to do, imports a conſtant acknowledgment, and ſenſe, of Gods Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, together with an awful reſpect, and vigilant care to pleaſe, or at leaſt not to offend Him. By which actuall faith, with this holy fruit of it, God is eminently glorified: where as in publick acts of vertue, or religion, a man may have many ends of his own, not only beſides, but without any reſpect to God. Though, where God's glory is ſincerely intended, it is more advanced by publick acts, than it can be by private; which is the ground of our

            <p>Fifthly, He that is faithful to the glory of God, will make conſcience of ſmall ſins, as well as great, never allowing himſelf liberty in the leaſt matter, that he knows to be diſagreeable to the will of God. As in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> caſe: A good Chriſtian muſt not only abſtain from offering ſacrifice to Idolls, but alſo from eating of ſuch ſacrifices.

The greateſt zeal for Gods glory is ſhewed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the leaſt actions, with care not to doe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:192161:51"/>him the leaſt diſhonour, or diſpleaſure. He that in ſmall things reſpects not the will of God, can have no more than a ſmall reſpect to him in the greateſt. The leaſt ſin, willfully committed, is a great one: and there is none little abſolutely, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the greatneſs of that Majeſty againſt whom it is committed.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, He that is truely zealous for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, will ſtudiouſly avoid all temptations and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of diſhououring him, out of a godly jealouſie of his own infirmity; not truſting to the freedom of his will, or ſtrength of his reſolution to reſiſt all temptations to ſin, becauſe he knoweth, that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the preſent ſtate of imperfection, leaves him in danger of conſenting, in caſe he be tempted to a ſin, that lies in his power. Whereas if he avoids the Temptation, he reſcues himſelf from the Danger, in as much as there can be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a ſin, without temptation. And it is the duty of a true lover of God, at leaſt it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a zealous one, to do what morally is in his power, to prevent the doing of any thing that may offend or diſhonour God. And the beſt way of preventing any thing, is to remove the cauſes; when therefore we are commanded by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to <hi>watch and pray that we enter not into temptation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.41.</note> and taught to pray that we may not be <hi>led into temptation;</hi> the meaning is not only (as ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters have given it) that we may not be overcome of temptation; but alſo that we may not be actually tempted, but delivered from the danger of temptation: which cannot be without preventing it, becauſe every temptation brings
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:192161:52"/>to the will. And though the name of temptation imports a ſeeming contradiction to any compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or abſolute neceſſity of yielding thereto; yet the ſame name doth alſo ſignifie a ſolicitation of the will which having yet no ſuch confirmation of grace, as that of Angels, and glorified Saints, is alwayes in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being overcome by temptation: Nor is it able by its own freedom to ſecure it ſelf from this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger without the grace of God. And though we have his Promiſe for a ſufficiency of Grace (if we ſeek and imbrace it) to inable us to reſiſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet that promiſe is not to be extended to ſuch temptations as are avoidable by our own wills, becauſe it implies (as all other promiſes do) the condition of doing what lies in our power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the effect of the grace.</p>
            <p>To be tempted to the greateſt ſin that can be, is no ſin. For our Bleſſed Saviour was tempted, to worſhip the Devil: But voluntarily to enter into temptation, or to conſent to the being tempted, is a ſin, and giving place to the Devil, who is the general Tempter. If Original Concupiſence were indeed no more than the Papiſts would have it in a regenerate man, <hi>peccati tanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A chaſt wife that regards her own and her husbands honour, will not admit of any avoidable temptation to the ſtaining thereof.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Laſtly he that deſires, that God ſhould be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in all that he doth, will be ſure to give God the glory of his well doing by an humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:192161:52"/>of his Grace, with Praiſe and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. And when he hath done evil, he will yet give glory to God, in ſuch a way as <hi>Joſhua</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>Achan</hi> to do, by confeſſing his ſin,
<note place="margin">Joſ. 7.19.</note> and humbling himſelf before God for it, by a hearty repentance; ſo that where Gods Glory was not the End, it may be the event and conſequent of his doings. If he hath done God any diſhonour by any ſcandalous ſin, he will indeavour to repair it; not onely by a private repentance, but by a retractation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the ſin before men, as publick as was the ſin.</p>

               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:192161:54"/>ſhort form of Meditated Prayer to that ſpecial end, or at leaſt, in an explicite Ejaculation. As ſoon as thou awakeſt in the morning, ſet God and his Glory before thee, as the ultimate end of that daies work, with a fervent deſire, and firm reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Firſt, of doing nothing wittingly, contrary to the Will of God: Secondly, of taking all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, and improving all talents, that ſhall be found in thy hands to honour and ſerve him. And, leſt thou ſhouldſt be diſcouraged from ſuch a ſtrict Exerciſe of Piety, by the fear of being thereby prejudiced or reſtrained, in thy ſecular imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or at leaſt in the uſe of lawful liberties and recreations; thou art to remember, thou haſt to do with a wiſe and gracious Father, who accounts himſelf ſerved and honoured by his Children, as well in the honeſt and neceſſary works of their reſpective callings, as in the ſolemn Exerciſes of Religion: and is not at all diſpleaſed with a ſober and moderate uſe of innocent recreations, either of minde or body: But when they are uſed in his fear, and limited by the known bounds of his Will, doth therein alſo eſteem himſelf honoured: After this morning vow, or devoting of thy ſelf to God, it will behoove thee to take diligent heed to thy ſelf all the day, that thou do not break it by any acts of preſumption, or negligence.</p>
            <p>And when thou haſt finiſhed that day, forget not to cloſe it with an evening ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving, for all the good that thou haſt received, or done therein. Give him the glory of that days work by a thankful acknowledgement of his Grace, in all that thou haſt done well: And by confeſſing thy miſ-doings, and humbling thy ſelf
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:192161:55"/>for thy failing in any thing which thou haſt done, or ſhouldſt have done: Firſt, examine thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether thou haſt been guilty of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſin, and let not that paſs without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and ſpecial repentance; and then add the Prayer of <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>cleanſe thee from thy ſecret ſins: (Pſal.</hi> 19.12.) that is, not ſuch as are unknown to men, but hidden and un-obſerved by thy ſelf, being the effects of ignorance, inadvertencie, or forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to conclude this diſcourſe: The laſt Rule of direction towards the obſervation of this general Precept, is, that which our Saviour, and his Apoſtles do require to be joyned with Prayer: to wit, the conſtant practice of vigilance, or watchfulneſs over our ſelves, and all our ways: <hi>Watch and pray</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that ye enter not into temptation:
<note place="margin">Matt. 26.41.</note> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always,
<note place="margin">Eph. 6.18.</note> with all prayer, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance.
<note place="margin">Col. 4.2.</note> Continue in prayer, and watch in the ſame with thanksgiving. Be ye ſober,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.7.</note> and watch unto prayer.</hi> If it be thy deſire, and deſign to do all things to the glory of God, let it be thy care to keep a conſtant guard upon thy ſelf, and to watch over thy thoughts, words and actions: The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this Duty, is the common cauſe of all that diſhonour that is done unto God, by ſuch perſons as are not without good affections towards him: And the practice hereof is of ſuch neceſſity, as without it, it is clearly as impoſſible to obſerve this Rule, as it is for a blinde man in an open Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian, to ſet every ſtep in a direct Path towards the place he would go to.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:192161:55"/>
            <p>As it is in actions, which are to be directed by the bodily Eye: the reaſon of error and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in ſuch actions proceeds from one of theſe Cauſes: Either from imperfection of the ſight, by reaſon of blindneſs, or dimneſs; or from a wilful rejection, and croſſing the direction of the ſight, or from a neglect, or non-attendance to the guide of the eyes. So it is in Moral actions, which are to be guided immediately by the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or conſcience, which is the Eye of the Soul. All the errors and ſins which are committed by men, do proceed from one of theſe Cauſes: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from ignorance and blindneſs of the minde, not underſtanding its Duty; or from a wilful op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and croſſing the dictates, and direction of Conſcience; or from not minding, and obſerving what a man doth. And this laſt is the common cauſe of their particular aberrations from this ſcope, or end of Gods Glory, who do not live without a general aym thereat.</p>
            <p>It appears therefore that the conſtant practice of this vigilance, is altogether as neceſſary, as is the general duty we have been ſpeaking of, which is not to be performed without it; becauſe, if it be rightly underſtood, it doth formally involve the practice of it: for (as hath been declared) the firſt thing that can be ſuppoſed in this Precept, is, that Chriſtians ſhould have ſuch a care of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that nothing be done againſt the Will and Glory of God: As the Text is briefly and plainly expounded by one of the Ancients;
<note place="margin">Admonitio ut nihil fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus contra Deum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> who after his manner of Elucidations of other Texts, puts theſe Queſtions upon the words:

<note place="margin">Sic omnia o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera noſtra circumſpectè fiant, ut nihil contra De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um fiat.</note> that we ſhould do all things to the glory of God, ſeeing we do many things no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and not therefore, that we may pleaſe God?</hi> He anſwers again to the ſame ſenſe: <hi>That all our works are to be done ſo circumſpectly, that nothing be done againſt God:</hi> What might have been added to theſe Anſwers by the Father, is before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the explication of this Duty: The quotation of his authority is but to confirm the neceſſity of this circumſpection, which without doubt is the main thing intended in the generality of the practice.</p>

But it is no other than St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, (who elſewhere argues ſo ſtrongly, and concludes ſo peremptorily againſt juſtification and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by works) who here exhorts Chriſtians to <hi>work out their own ſalvation.</hi> And, that by this <hi>work,</hi> he intends ſomething more, than ſuch a <hi>faith,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts onely in a confident perſwaſion, or aſſurance of a mans own ſalvation, already wrought out for him by his Saviour, is ſufficiently evident from his additional terms, concerning the manner of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing this work, <hi>viz. with fear and trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Text alone (were there no other to prove it) would be ſufficient to confirm the truth of the <hi>Father's</hi> words; <hi>That he that made us, without us; will not ſave us, without us:</hi> Our Creation implies a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:192161:57"/>contradiction to any poſſibility of our co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereunto, becauſe it imports our being really Nothing before it: But that humble <hi>Nothingneſs</hi> that now we pretend to, muſt not excuſe us from all care of working out our own ſalvation, becauſe it doth not deprive us of all capacity of ſo doing: For, from this Scripture, and many others, we are taught, that how ſolidly, and intirely ſoever, the effect of mans Salvation, is to be attributed to the free grace of God in Chriſt; yet, that it is not to be attained without all manner of co-operation from himſelf: I ſay, from Scripture it is, that we learn, that our ſalvation is effected by ſomething wrought by us, as well as for us, or in us.</p>
            <p>But the words of the Text are fully ſalved from all appearance of prejudice to the free grace of God, by thoſe that do immediately follow them, in the next verſe. <hi>For it is God that worketh in you both to will, and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are taught that the work which is to be done by us, in order to our own ſalvation, doth indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily depend upon the good pleaſure of God, that is, upon his preventing, operating, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating grace; without which, nothing can be done by us, available to this end: But ſo far is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it behoveth every Chriſtian to work out his own ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this Propoſition my purpoſe is to ſpeak plainly, by way of <hi>Explication</hi> and <hi>Application.</hi> Firſt, By way of Explication, we ſhall enquire, 1. What this <hi>ſalvation</hi> means, which is to be wrought out. 2. What it is <hi>to work out our own ſalvation;</hi> or, what is the full importance of that Phraſe. 3. How, or whereby this ſalvation may, or ought to be wrought out. 4. What is meant by thoſe words (which concern the manner of this work) — <hi>with fear and trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, We are to conſider, what this Salvation means: That being rightly underſtood, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly believed, contains ſo powerful a Motive of the duty which the Text requires, as makes it ſcarce poſſible to be neglected: eſpecially, if the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:192161:58"/>Philoſopher,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Phyſ. Thom.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 82. <hi>a.</hi> 1.</note> and the School-man, be not deceived, whil'ſt they teach us, that every one doth naturally, and neceſſarily, deſire his own Happineſs. For, if that be ſo, how can it be, that a man ſhould wholly neglect that thing, wherein, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, and believes his onely happineſs to conſiſt? So that the general reaſon, why this work is ſo much neglected, ſeems to be, becauſe either the end, or the work which is neceſſary to it, is not rightly underſtood, or not duly believed: My bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs therefore ſhall be (as plainly as I can) to inform the underſtanding, in each particular: that is, both <hi>what this ſalvation is,</hi> and <hi>what work is abſolutely neceſſary to the attainment thereof.</hi> But, when this is done; to undertake alſo, to perſwade the belief of it, by any other evidence, than will be contained in the reſpective explication and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the matter of it, from Scripture, (from whence onely it can be declared) is not to be expected by Chriſtians, becauſe their being ſuch, ſuppoſeth their belief of that evidence, and is no leſs than a contradiction to the want of that faith.</p>
            <p>Come we then to the firſt of our Enquiries: viz. <hi>What this ſalvation is,</hi> which the Text ſpeaks of? For the underſtanding of that word, a fit riſe may be taken from the interpretation of the bleſſed Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> given by the Archangel to the Mother of our Saviour, the Author of this ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S; for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> There can be no doubt, but that this is the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which our Text ſpeaks of. For ſalvation
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:192161:58"/>properly ſignifies, preſervation or deliverance from evil. And all the evil that is in the world, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin, or the conſequent and puniſhment of ſin. The firſt, and the greateſt evil, is that of ſin, which being the cauſe of the evil of puniſhment, that alſo is comprehended under the name of ſin, by an ordinary Metonymie. But then to confine the ſignification of the word (Sin) in the Angel's Speech, to this ſecondary and figurative ſenſe, (wherein it's taken for the puniſhment of ſin) with excluſion of the firſt and moſt proper ſenſe, cannot be reaſonable; except it may appear to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: which cannot be, unleſs the deſign of this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> were onely to deliver men from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not at all from the dominion, and practice of ſin. The contrary whereof, is evident by thoſe many Texts of Scripture, wherein we are taught,
<note place="margin">Matth, 9.13, Acts 3.26.</note> That <hi>he came to call ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance:</hi> That, <hi>God ſent his ſon, Jeſus, to bleſs us, in turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way every one of us, from his iniquities.</hi> That, <hi>we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies,

<note place="margin">Eph. 5.25.</note> and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie, and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water by the word, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> That, <hi>he died for all, that they which live,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.15.</note> ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi> That, <hi>he was manifeſted to take away our ſins,

            <p>And as the word <hi>ſave,</hi> is thus to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the compleat ſenſe of the Angel's words, before-mentioned; ſo may it be in divers other Texts: As in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5, 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40.</p>

            <p>Notwithſtanding, becauſe the ordinary received ſenſe of this word, in the New Teſtament, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the deliverance of men, from the final puniſhment of ſin in the world to come; I ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that to be the principal meaning of it, in this place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salvation</hi> in the ſtyle of the Old Teſtament, doth ordinarily ſignifie no more than <hi>deliverance from temporal evils,</hi> whereto men are liable in this world.

<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 1.10.</note> from eternal damnation, from the wrath to come, from the ſecond death, the vengeance of eternal fire, in the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone.</hi> This is that which the Apoſtle (from the matter, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from the Author of it) calls the <hi>great ſalvation.</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192161:60"/>but by ampliation, and analogy of Scripture, the ſame word comprehends alſo, all that happineſs, and bleſſedneſs, which the Goſpel promiſeth to them that ſhall be ſaved, and which is uſually expreſſed by <hi>eternal life.</hi> The full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the word <hi>ſalvation,</hi> comprehends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from all the curſes and threatnings, both of Law, and Goſpel, together with all <hi>thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, and precious promiſes,</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>Now concerning both theſe things, I ſhall onely add two Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That both the puniſhment threatned, and the happineſs promiſed, are expreſſed in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the higheſt terms that could have been uſed. The miſery from which this ſalvation delivers us, is ſet forth by the moſt formidable terms, that can be ſounded to mortal ears. Such are thoſe, of <hi>death, deſtruction, everlaſting unquenchable fire, a lake that burns with fire and brimſtone, wherein men are to be tormented day and night for ever, and ever; where there is nothing but weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth; utter darkneſs, and the worm that never dies, &amp;c.</hi> What words can ſignifie any thing more formidable than theſe do? On the other ſide, the happineſs of them that ſhall be ſaved, is likewiſe worded as high, as was poſſible to be; to wit, by the terms of <hi>everlaſting life, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal joy, bleſſedneſs, ſeeing of God, being and raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Chriſt, in Heaven, a Kingdom, a Crown of glory; a farre more, exceeding, eternal weight of glory; an incorruptible inheritance, a treaſure, a paradiſe, a feaſt, &amp;c.</hi> It is certain, there are no words, which can ſignifie any thing more valuable
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192161:60"/>than thoſe do which Scripture uſeth (in great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety) to ſet forth that happineſs by. Let this be the firſt Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is this, that the infallible truth, and ſimplicity of Gods Word, doth require, that the reſpective eſtates, declared by theſe expreſſions, ſhould be anſwerable to the height of their ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. That is, that although many of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, being figurative, do import ſomething different from the common ſignification of the words, and that therefore a perfect, and diſtinct notion, or underſtanding of the particular conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereby expreſſed, cannot be collected or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended from them; yet that the reality of the things thereby ſignified, is at leaſt equal to that which any, or all thoſe words, can repreſent to our preſent underſtanding: <hi>i. e.</hi> The miſery of the one, and the happineſs of the other ſtate, muſt needs be as great as thoſe expreſſions, by which they are deſcribed, can reaſonably ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the end or object, <hi>ſalvation,</hi> and what that means: which I deſire may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and conſidered as a moſt powerfull Motive, to the Act, which in the next place we are to ſpeak of.</p>
            <p>We have heard of the end or deſign propoſed in the Text, that is, <hi>our own ſalvation,</hi> which by the precedent diſcourſe is concluded to ſignifie, (beſides deliverance from extremity of miſery) the utmoſt of happineſs, which a man is capable of, and conſequently to be the chiefeſt good, and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end of a man, which nature, and reaſon doth oblige him to ſeek. Come we now to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:192161:61"/>work that is to be done, in order to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing this end: <hi>Work out your own ſalvation.</hi> We ſhall firſt inquire what that means, and then how it is to be effected.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Work out:</hi>

A man is then ſaid to have wrought out a buſineſs, when he hath finiſhed, and perfectly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it. So that <hi>to work out our own ſalvation,</hi> imports theſe two things: Firſt, To make it our work and buſineſs, to effect and attain this end, which the Apoſtle calls the <hi>end of our faith, the ſalvation of our ſouls,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. Secondly, To purſue and follow this work, with all care and diligence, till we have finiſhed it, and brought it to perfection; that is, not onely till we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a preſent right to, or intereſt in, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance;
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.11. &amp; 10.22.</note> or till we come to a certain Plerophory, or <hi>full aſſurance</hi> of hope, or faith, that we are in the ſtate of ſalvation; but, till we come to the end

               <hi>If by any means we might attain unto the reſurrection of the dead: i. e.</hi> the reſurrection of the juſt: <hi>Not as though</hi> we <hi>had already attained, either were already perfect: But,</hi> we are to <hi>follow after,</hi> if that <hi>we may apprehend that for which alſo we are apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Not counting our ſelves to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended:

               <hi>but this one thing</hi> we are <hi>to do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth</hi> (<hi>i, e.</hi> contending with all our might and force, like to them that run a race) <hi>unto thoſe things which are before,</hi> we are <hi>to preſs towards the mark, for the prize of the high Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be noted that the Exhortation in the Text, is directed to ſuch, as being Believers and Saints (as they are called in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this Epiſtle) had already begun this good work,
<note place="margin">Cap. 1.1.</note> and <hi>were</hi> preſumed to be in a ſtate of ſalvation. Yet ſtill the Apoſtle exhorts them <hi>to work out their own ſalvation.</hi> Thereby teaching them, and all Chriſtians, that this work is not finiſhed, by any ſingle act, or habit of faith; but remains to be compleated and perfected, by the <hi>perfecting of holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> 'Tis not a work that may be diſpatched, or finiſhed, and laid aſide; but muſt be purſued to the laſt, as long as we can work. A man may come into a certain intereſt, and right unto ſalvation, not onely before his death, but almoſt as ſoon as he lives, by vertue of an early Baptiſm; whereby (as our Church teacheth her Catechumens) <hi>he is made a member of Chriſt, a child of God, and an inheritor of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:192161:62"/>of heaven:</hi> But this right being conveyed upon certain conditions covenanted for in Baptiſm, cannot be held, much leſs crowned with poſſeſſion of the inheritance, without the performance of thoſe conditions, which can never be finiſhed, till our life be at end; becauſe the perſeverance in them till then, is part of the condition. For it is part of the condition of ſalvation, (and not only of the duty of them that ſhall be ſaved;)
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.6.14.</note> 
               <hi>to hold faſt the beginning of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> of their Chriſtian Profeſſion) <hi>unto the end:
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.10. John 15.6. 1 Tim. 1.19. Col. 1.23. Heb. 12.1. 2 John 8.</note> To be faithful to the death: To abide in Chriſt: Holding faith and a good conſcience: To continue in the faith, grounded and ſetled: To run with patience the race that is ſet before them: Looking to themſelves, that they loſe not the things, which we have wrought; but that we may receive a full reward.</hi> Which laſt words, do imply, that there is ſome danger of a Chriſtian's loſing the benefit of his firſt Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if he purſues it not with carefulneſs to the end.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any controverſie in the point, but that the right unto ſalvation, muſt needs be loſt, if a man falls away from the condition, by which it is held. Elſe an unbeliever may be ſaved, becauſe he that continues not in the faith, is no believer. He therefore that gives over the work which the Text requireth, can never be ſaved. But whether this work once truly begun, can be given over, before it be wrought out, is a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and may, for me, reſt for ſuch, in this place; ſo I may have leave to diſmiſs it, with entring my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:192161:62"/>moſt ſerious Caution to all Chriſtians, upon the peril of their ſouls, to take heed of preſuming ſo far upon the certainty of their perſeverance, that, they be tempted to neglect the duty of the Text; which is ſtill <hi>to work out their own ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> For ſure I am, that Scripture affords many admonitions to the beſt of men, to take heed of falling away, and inforceth ſome of them with arguments drawn from the pain of damnation: which is ſuch an objection againſt an abſolute impoſſibility of loſing the grace of God, or of not perſevering in it, as I ſhall not undertake to anſwer: For he that ſhould at the ſame time pretend to aſſure me, that it were impoſſible for me to die, and yet labour to keep me in awe of death, by the moſt ſerious warnings, and ſtrong perſwaſions to take heed of it, would appear to be guilty of abuſing my faith, or my reaſon; either by a falſhood in one part of his ſuggeſtion, or by a groſs incongruity in the other: becauſe I cannot underſtand what need of caution there can be, where there is an abſolute impoſſibility of effective peril.</p>
            <p>And now it is time that I ſhould come to the next queſtion propoſed in my method; <hi>viz.</hi> What this work is, that is to be done by him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to work out his own ſalvation? which ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the moſt important queſtion that can be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and which needs the cleareſt, and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Reſolution: and therefore I think it moſt ſafe, to ſtudy plainneſs and ſolidity, rather than brevity in my Anſwer.</p>
            <p>It is evident that the only certain reſolution of this queſtion, is to be learned from Scripture; from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:192161:63"/>whence only we have the knowledge of this ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That there is ſuch a ſtate as that of <hi>Salvation,</hi> before deſcribed, cannot certainly be known, but from the revelation of Scripture; and therefore the way, and means, to attain it, is only to be learned from thence. We muſt therefore <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">John 5.39.</note> for in them we think to have everlaſting life.</hi> It concerns us to examine diligently, what works, conditions, or qualifications, are by them required to attain this end. And to prevent all error in this inquiry, I hold it neceſſary to give this Praemonition; <hi>viz.</hi> That it will not be ſo ſafe to reſt altogether, upon the declaration of any one Text, for the perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of this queſtion; as it may be, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (as near as we can) and compare all Texts that make mention of any conditions, acts, practices, or qualifications, required as neceſſary to ſalvation. It being known to every one that hath read, or heard the Scriptures with any obſervation, that the conditions of ſalvation laid down in ſeveral Texts, are many, and of a diverſe ſignification; ſome Texts ſhewing what things are poſitively required, to be found in, or done by, them which will be ſaved; others making mention of ſuch things as do exclude men from ſalvation. Some things there are, which (as the

Heb. 6.9.</note> Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>do accompany ſalvation;</hi> that is, which are preparatory to eternal bliſs; and which being found in a man, do declare him to be in a near capacity of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with ſuch a preſent capacity, and as abſolute barn and impediments to that ſtate. Each of theſe things
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:192161:63"/>are carefully to be obſerved, to the end a man may acquire, and perform the one, and eſchew or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf of the other. Some inſtances of each kind may be found in theſe Texts, amongſt many others left to the diligent obſervation of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>to the</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. <hi>to the</hi> 25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14, 15. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>to the</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it is not reaſonable, for me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſet down, much leſs to expound all the Texts which are to be found in Scripture pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this end. I ſhall take up, with a few of them, and principally with three, to which all others may be referred; and which are the more remarkable; becauſe they were purpoſely deſigned, by our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour himſelf, and the two great Apoſtles, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for a diſtinct anſwer to the queſtion we have propounded, <hi>i. e. What a man ſhould do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the reſolution of the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, that directs the admonition in the Text. When the Gaoler (ſympathiſing with the quaking Earth) with fear and trembling came to him and <hi>Silas</hi> (his fellow-priſoner) inquiring, <hi>What he muſt do to be ſaved? They ſaid, Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Acts</hi> 16.30, 31. The ſame anſwer was given by our bleſſed Saviour himſelf to the Jews, that put the queſtion to him, <hi>What they ſhould do, that they might work the works of God?</hi> Which queſtion bears the ſame ſenſe with that of the Gaoler, as appears by the occaſion of it, expreſſed in the fore-going verſe; where our Saviour had bidden them, <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat, which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:192161:64"/>endureth to eternal life.</hi> Hereupon they moved this queſtion, What was that work, which God had appointed them to do, in order to that end, which he had preſcribed them; that is, to <hi>obtain that mean which endureth to everlaſting life:</hi> which is all one with, What they ſhould do, <hi>to work out their own ſalvation? Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, This is the work of God</hi> (meaning not now the work which God works, but which he requires of them to work) <hi>that ye beleeve on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> John 6.27, 28, 29. This then appears to be the firſt and principal work (ſo called by our Saviour) to be done by him that deſigns to work out his own ſalvation, <hi>viz.</hi> to believe on Jeſus Chriſt, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſalvation. This is the term, by which the condition of ſalvation is moſt commonly expreſſed, both in the Goſpels, and Epiſtles, eſpecially of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> who laboureth much to confirm the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of <hi>Juſtification by faith in Chriſt.</hi> And, to be juſtified, is, to be put into a ſtate of ſalvation; wherefore alſo he ſaith, <hi>By grace ye are ſaved, through faith,</hi> Eph. 2.8. Jeſus Chriſt being the Author of this ſalvation, the way to attain unto it, in reaſon, muſt needs be, to believe in him: For nothing can be more reaſonable, than that they that will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto ſalvation, ſhould be obliged to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the only Author thereof, and depend upon him for it: eſpecially, ſince he hath purchaſed it for us, at ſo dear a rate as that of his own blood; it was moſt highly equitable, that he ſhould have the honour of it, which is given him by faith; as that imports an affiance or truſt in him, for the attainment thereof.</p>
            <p>Faith in Chriſt therefore, is the undoubted foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:192161:64"/>of our hope, and the prime title to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And that being ſo, proves, that every man is as much concern'd to work out his Faith, as he is to work out his own Salvation: Which that he may do, it is at leaſt very requiſit, that he ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what this <hi>Faith</hi> is. Although the end of this Faith, which is the ſalvation of the Soul, doth not neceſſarily depend upon the truth of the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that a man hath of it, but upon the truth of the thing it ſelf: For it is no leſſe poſſible for a man to have a true Faith, that hath a falſe notion of it, than it is for a man to attain unto Salvation, and the felicities of Eternal life, although he neither hath, nor can have, any exact notion thereof in this life: Or, than it is to have a reaſonable ſoul, and to act reaſonably thereby, though a man knows nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what the Soul, nor yet what Reaſon is. As the <hi>Sadduces</hi> that believed not that there were any Spirits at all, were nevertheleſs informed with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and immortal Spirits: Yet in as much as the want of a right underſtanding of the nature of a true <hi>Faith,</hi> may render a man liable to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as well in the practice, as in the notion thereof, it is hugely neceſſary that he be poſſeſſed with a right knowledg of this <hi>work</hi> of God: as I may take leave to call it after our Saviour in the forementioned Text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. And after St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. <hi>Remembring your work of Faith.</hi> Which term,
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.11.</note> beſide that agreement that it hath with my Text, is uſeful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the reſolution of that great Queſtion, <hi>What Faith it is, to which the Scripture doth ſo often attribute the effect of juſtification, and Salvation.</hi> For by theſe Texts (and many others hereafter to be quoted)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:192161:65"/>we may learn, that the true juſtifying and ſaving Faith, is not, 1. A bare notional, hiſtorical, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Faith, conſiſting altogether in the aſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For if it were true that the only ſaving faith, conſiſted in an aſſurance of ſalvation, and that a full one, as it is defined; whoſoever finds himſelf to want that aſſurance (which very few of the beſt Chriſtians, will pretend to) muſt needs conclude himſelf to have no true Faith: whereas in truth, this Aſſurance is purely accidental to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:192161:67"/>it is, that the knowledg of God in Scripture-phraſe, doth import obedience to his Commandments, that S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hereby we know, that we know him, if we keep his Commandments. He that ſaith, I know him; and keepeth not his Commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2, 3, 4. And if that be ſo, what truth can be in him that ſaith, he believes in God, and keeps not his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. For either our knowledg of God is the ſame thing with our beliefe; and then what is true of the one muſt be equally true of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Or, if Faith be diſtinguiſhed from knowledg, (as in a philoſophical notion it is) then our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe ſuppoſeth our knowledge, that is, that we have a true notion of his nature and eſſence, whereto the right of univerſal dominion doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily belong; and addes thereunto a firm aſſent of the mind,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> to the verity of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, <hi>i.e. that he is the only true God,</hi> and thereby obligeth our obedience to him. This Notion of Faith is notably declared and exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2, 4, 7, 8, 17. <hi>By Faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent ſacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witneſſe that he was righteous. By Faith Noah being warn'd of God,</hi> of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear prepared an Arke, to the ſaving of his houſe; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteouneſs, which is by Faith. By Faith <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when he was called to go into a place which he ſhould afterwards receive for an inheritance, obeyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was tried offered up <hi>Iſaak:</hi> and he that had received the promiſes, offered up his only begotten Son.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:192161:68"/>And this was the Faith which was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs: that is, by which he was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</p>
            <p>But for a final confirmation of this notion of ſaving Faith, as the only complete one, (I mean, this practick Notion) I ſhall add no more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, than what may be inferr'd from thoſe Texts of Scripture, wherein there is the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of expreſſing it; that is, thoſe Texts, wherein this ſaving Faith is deſcribed by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Act, than that by which we believe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theſe Propoſitions, <hi>That Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that he was raiſed from the dead, &amp;c.</hi> John 20.39. <hi>Theſe things, are written that ye might believe, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, and that believing, ye might have life through his Name.</hi> Rom. 10.9, 10. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth, the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved: For, with the heart, man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the mouth Confeſſion is made unto Salvation:</hi> 1 John 5.1. <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God: No man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. This was the <hi>Eunuch</hi>'s Faith. whereupon he was admitted to Baptiſm by Saint <hi>Philip: I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God:</hi> Acts 8.37. This was the Faith, for which our Saviour pronounceth <hi>Simon Peter</hi> bleſſed, Matth. 16.16, 17. <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> The ſame was the Faith of <hi>Martha,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe expected the Promiſe of Life declared by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 11.26, 27: I demand now, What kind of Faith it is, that is to be underſtood in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192161:68"/>theſe Texts? Is it no other than a certain, real, and unfained aſſent to the truth of theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions? and ſhall every ſuch Believer be ſaved? or, is he born of God? Surely, no man that reads the Scriptures, can think ſo: If then this ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, dogmatical Faith, though never ſo true, in a philoſophical ſenſe, (that is, not only in reſpect of the Object, but alſo in reſpect of the Act of Aſſent) be not the true ſaving Faith; What can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t be but the practical Faith, which anſwers to the foremention'd Notion, of a practical knowledge of God; that is, ſuch a Faith as effectually produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all ſuch affections, and obedience to Chriſt, with dependence upon him, as the belief of theſe Propoſitions obligeth a man to? I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that theſe Texts, and all others, wherein Faith is named as the ſole condition of Salvation, are to be interpreted by that ſingle one of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> above mention'd, Gal. 5.6. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumciſion, nor uncircumciſion, availeth any thing, but Faith which worketh by Love.</hi> So much for that firſt Reſolution to the Queſtion in hand, given by our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> viz. That he that will work out his own Salvation, muſt <hi>believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Not as <hi>Jeſus</hi> only, or a Saviour, but as the <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And to work out this Condition,
<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 1.3.</note> is that which he calls <hi>the Work of Faith:</hi> being the Work of Obedience to the Lord Jeſus, who is <hi>the Author of Eternal Salvation to them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. that is, to them that ſo believe in him, as to obey him.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:192161:69"/>
            <p>TO this agrees an other Anſwer which our bleſſed Saviour made to one that put the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to him in expreſs terms, Matth. 19.17. and Mark 10.17. <hi>And behold one came, and ſaid unto him, Good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do that I may have Eternal Life; And he ſaid unto him— If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments:</hi> Which words (being the Anſwer of him who is the Author of Salvation, and who beſt knew the Condition, whereupon it was to be had, and had leaſt reaſon to utter any thing to the prejudice of his own merits) do plainly ſhew, that the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commandments (in ſome ſenſe or other) is neceſſary for him that will be ſaved, as well under the Goſpel, as under the Law.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that this ſpeech of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath received ſuch an interpretation from divers modern Interpreters, as ſeems to imply the quite contrary to this inference, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe words were not deſigned for a direct Anſwer to the young man's queſtion, as ſerving to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him what he was to do to enter into Life; but intended rather to diſcover unto him, his inability to attain Salvation, by any thing that he could do, and thereby to draw him to ſeek it out of himſelf; and diſpoſe him to imbrace the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical way of Salvation, by Faith in him (the Saviour,) without Works.</p>
            <p>But this Interpretation (with due reverence to the Authors and Abetters thereof) ſeems to me improbable, upon diverſe Accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it makes our Saviour's Anſwer to be indirect, and inſufficient, at leaſt; if not untrue.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:192161:69"/>For, whereas the man's Inquiry was, What he was to do that he might be ſaved; this Anſwer, by this interpretation, gives him either no direction at all; or ſuch a one, as was either not true, or not ſufficient, and by this Hypotheſis, impoſſible to be performed: The keeping of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was either neceſſary to Salvation, or it was not. If it were neceſſary; Why ſhould our Saviour, whiles he ſeems ſo plainly to affirm it, be ſuppoſed not to intend it? If it were; How could this be a true Anſwer to the Queſtion?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe I neither find any Circumſtance in, or about this Text, nor any neceſſity from any other, to incline me to preferr ſuch an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, obſcure interpretation of our Saviour's words, before that which is direct and plain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe this ſenſe is diſagreeable to a ſecond Anſwer that our Saviour made, to the reply of this Queſtioniſt; alledging, himſelf (how tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is not to the purpoſe) to have kept thoſe Commandments. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell that thou haſt, and give to the Poor, and thou ſhalt have Treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and come, and follow me.</hi> Which laſt words, do indeed imply a neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt, without which no man can come to him; but they do alſo as plainly teach, a neceſſity of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience too, without which no man can be ſaid <hi>to follow him.</hi> And the whole Anſwer doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate, that it was not only neceſſary for him, to endeavour the keeping of thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, if he <hi>would enter into L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fe,</hi> but that he muſt do more than ſo, namely be ready upon his command, to part withall that he had, to follow him, as his Diſciples had done.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:192161:70"/>
            <p>4. Becauſe the foremention'd Interpretation ſeems to have been deviſed of purpoſe to exclude the neceſſity of Obedience to Salvation: and to ſecure the Doctrine of Salvation by Faith only, without Works, in ſuch a ſenſe as St. <hi>Paul</hi> never meant. Therefore I find no ſuch interpretation in any of the Ancients, before the Controverſie about Works was raiſed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe the ſame neceſſity of Works of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Salvation, that ſeems to be taught by our Saviour in this Text, is fully and plainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by himſelf, and his Apoſtles, in many other Texts. As Mat. 5.20. <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Where, by the Sequel of his Diſcourſe, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he ſpeaks not of a meer <hi>imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> but ſuch a one as is <hi>inherent and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> conſiſting in the obſervation of the Precepts there; afterward mention'd by himſelf, in the ſame, and the two following Chapters. And, as it were of purpoſe to prevent the error of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifidian Doctrine, or a preſumption of Salvation by Faith without Works; he expreſſeth himſelf moſt clearly, Chap. 7.21: <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord,</hi> (that is, pretendeth, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to believe on me) <hi>ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, but he that doth the Will of my Father, which is in Heaven.</hi> The whole Sermon, contain'd in thoſe 3. Chapters, is a ſummary of the Law of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. The Chriſtian Ethicks, or the inſtitutions of the Chriſtian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy: The main Scope whereof, is to ſhew upon what terms, and conditions, that Kingdom of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:192161:70"/>Heaven, which he preached, and promiſed, was to be obtained: as may appear, both from the beginning, and end of the Sermon. For, as it begins with the Promiſe of Bleſſedneſs, limited to the endowments and practice of ſpecial Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Vertues, ſuch as Humility, Meekneſs, Mercy, purity of Heart, Peace, and Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo it ends with a peremptory aſſertion of the neceſſity of Obedience to the Precepts before delivered. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. to the end: <hi>Therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him unto a wiſe man, which built his Houſe upon a Rock,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And every one that heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them not, ſhall be likened unto a fooliſh man, which built his Houſe upon the Sand,</hi> &amp;c. Which words can ſignifie no leſs, than that all hopes of Salvation, that are built upon any other Foundation, than that of Obedience to his Precepts, as the proper effect, fruit, and trial of an unfained Faith in him, are built upon the Sands: Or, that the ſtudy of conformity to his Commandments, is fundamentally neceſſary to the hope of everlaſting Life. From whence this Inference ſeems to be neceſſary: that, to believe there is no ſuch neceſſity of good Works to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is no leſs than a fundamental Error, in the Chriſtian Profeſſion: And ſo (without doubt) it is, if it be held practically; But becauſe ſuch an erroneous Opinion, notionally held, may be conſiſtent with the real practice of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Obedience, (as I doubt not but that it is, in many <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and ſome <hi>Antinomians</hi>) it doth not neceſſarily exclude from Salvation. For, whoſoever heareth Chriſt's ſayings, and doth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:192161:71"/>them, is by our Saviour likened unto a wiſe man, that built his Houſe upon a Rock, and therefore ſhall undoubtedly be ſaved, whether he believes his Obedience neceſſary to Salvation, or not. A ſimple error in the Underſtanding, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually corrected in the Will, (I believe) ſhall never be imputed to the honeſt-minded man.</p>
            <p>But conſidering the natural influence of the Underſtanding upon the Will, this Hereſie (though not in it ſelf to be reckon'd in the number of thoſe, which St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls damnable) may yet eaſily prove ſo. And therefore, though it muſt needs exerciſe the Patience of an intelligent Orthodox Reader, to add to theſe expreſs words of our Saviour, ſo many Teſtimonies of his Apoſtles, as might be alledged from their Epiſtles, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this Doctrine: Yet their pardon muſt be allowed for the mentioning of ſome of them, towards the removal of ſo dangerous an Error, as the ſame Apoſtles thought neceſſary to warn Chriſtians of, by many Emphatical Texts: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, after he had mſiſted ſo much, in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> upon the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, without the Works of the Law, doth ſpecially caution both Churches to take heed of this miſpriſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die; but, if ye, through the Spirit, do mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live:</hi> See Gal. 5.6.21. and Chap. 6. v. 7, 8, 9.15: <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall be alſo reap. For he that ſoweth to his Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting. Know ye not that the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:192161:71"/>unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, &amp;c. ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> 1. Cor. 6.9, 10. St. <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 2. ſpends a whole Chapter to undeceive Chriſtians of this Error: St. <hi>John</hi> gives the ſame admonition: 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Little Children, let no man deceive you, he that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous, as he is righteous.</hi> He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil; &amp;c. What can be plainer than the words of our Saviour? Rev. 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gates into the City.</hi> viz. the heavenly <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> From whence it is to be concluded beyond diſpute, that howſoever the right to this heavenly Inheritance, be at firſt obtained by the act of an <hi>unfeined Faith in Chriſt;</hi> yet it is held by the homage of <hi>Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with that General Doctrine ſo oft delivered, as well in the <hi>New,</hi>

               </note> is one of the five Articles of that Faith, which a late Author hath endeavoured to prove to be as Catholick, as Reaſon it ſelf: And therefore was never left out in any Religion that hath obtain'd in the World. Nor was ever denied by any Philoſophers, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:192161:72"/>the immortality of the Soul, and any Life after this. No Religion can be made out to be rational in the Theorie, much leſs perſwaded into Practice, without the eſtabliſhment of this Principle: which being eſtabliſhed, doth certainly inferre a neceſſity of keeping God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in order to the hopes of eternal Life: which was the thing to be demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>But againſt this Doctrine many things may be objected; as 1. That it ſeems to evacuate the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the <hi>old,</hi> and <hi>new</hi> Covenants, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the condition of them, which, by this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> ſeems to be the ſame, viz. <hi>Do this and Live:</hi> 2. That it layes a burthen upon Chriſtians, as heavie as that which the Jews were never able to bear; and gives occaſion for the Diſciples Queſtion; <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi> 3. That it ſeems to contradict Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification by Faith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.44.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works. 4. And to favour the Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Merit.</p>
            <p>Theſe Objections will be moſt conveniently anſwered, after we have conſidered the third Text, from whence we deſigned to complete the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to that great <hi>Queſtion,</hi> What we ſhould do to be ſaved? A Queſtion put to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, by the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38.39. <hi>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and ſaid unto</hi> Peter, <hi>and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and Bretheren, what ſhall we do? Then</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid unto them, Repent, and be baptized, &amp;c.</hi> The neceſſity of Baptiſm to Salvation, (grounded upon the words of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 3.5, 6.) is not here to be diſcuſſed, becauſe it can have no place

As appears by many other Texts of Scripture, wherein the neceſſity of Repentance to Salvation, is expreſly taught: It was the firſt Evangelical Precept, the very firſt word, whereby the Goſpel began to be preached, both by the fore-runner, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and by our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2. and 4.17. So <hi>John</hi> began his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Wilderneſs, ſaying, <hi>Repent ye, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;</hi> In like manner <hi>Jeſus began to preach; and to ſay; Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand:</hi> Intimating, that whoſoever deſired any part in that Kingdom, muſt qualifie himſelf for it by <hi>Repentance:</hi> It was the end of our Saviour's coming into the World, as himſelf faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I am come to call Sinners to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> And, when he left the World to the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Apoſtles, his Appointment was, <hi>that Repentance, and Remiſſion of Sin, ſhould be preached in his name among all Nations,</hi> Luk. 24.47: For, <hi>Him hath God exalted, with his right hand to be a Prince; and a Saviour, to give Repentance to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and Remiſſion of Sin.</hi> Acts 5.31. <hi>Not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. In theſe, and many other Texts, the intire condition of Salvation, is expreſſed by this term of Repentance: which is therefore called <hi>Reptenance unto Life,</hi> and <hi>Repentance to ſalvation:</hi> Acts 11.18: 2 Cor. 7.10.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:192161:73"/>
            <p>The equity and neceſſity of this condition, unto the Remiſſion of Sin, is not (as I conceive) grounded upon any arbitrary, or poſitive Will o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> natural Reaſon, if it be not groſly corrupted by Self-love, or perverted and abuſed by Superſtitions inſtructions, will certainly teach a man this Leſſons That, to qualifie him for, and render him capable of a Pardon,
<note place="margin">Luk. 17.3.</note> for any wilful offence, (if it be but againſt a man) it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary he ſhould Repent the doing of it. Becauſe the want of this Repentance, ſuppoſeth the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Offence, or, at leaſt, a wilful conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in it: which makes the pardon, without it, to imply an allowance, or toleration of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and makes the offended party to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled as well to the iniquity of the Offender, as to his Perſon: Which being perfectly unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhews the indiſpenſableneſs of this qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for the ſalvation of a Sinner, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the remiſſion of his Sin.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it is to be believed, that Heathens, by the light of natural Reaſon, as oft as they would attend unto it, could not but underſtand the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Repentance, for the averting God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the hope of pardon for ſuch groſs Crimes as their Conſciences were terrified with. And though they might conclude, more than probably, (from the Goodneſs of God, eſſentially included in the notion of his Being, and ſufficiently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Works) that he was reconcilable to ſinners, upon ſome terms or other; yet, to believe him willing to pardon foul iniquities, without
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:192161:73"/>exacting the Repentance of the Offenders, was ſuch an abſurdity as could not be entertained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notorious corruption of their Reaſon. But, by the Hiſtory we have of their Religion, it appears they were ſo much abuſed with preſcription of other wayes and means of expiating their ſins (to wit, by Sacrifices, ritual Purgations, and Luſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuggeſted by their covetous Prieſts) that there is indeed little mention of this Doctrine of Repentance amongſt them. The very word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rarely to be found in their books. And no marvel they ſhould be diſpoſed to liſten after other ways of purging their ſins (which were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilable with retaining the practice;) ſeeing the whole maſs of corrupt Nature is found to be as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to the remedy of Repentance, as it is prone to the Sin that needs it.</p>
            <p>It was the deluſion, and the hypocriſie of the Jewes, to truſt to other Remedies of Sin, with neglect of this, as we find by the frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Prophets. Nor are Chriſtians any better affected to this wholſome Cure for Sin: but every whit as much inclined to elude the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, or at leaſt to cheat their own Souls in the hypocritical pretence of it. But the more Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there is for the neceſſity of Repentance unto Salvation, the more neceſſary it is to have a right Notion of the Nature of it. Becauſe the miſtake in this point is no leſs dangerous, than in that of Faith. Nor are men leſs apt to be deceived in the one, than in the other. And if there be indeed an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable neceſſity of Repentance, as well as Faith, unto Salvation; the carnal mind is not ſo ſollicitous to find out the trueſt as the eaſieſt notion of them
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:192161:74"/>both; that is, ſuch a one sa is practicable, with the leaſt reſtraint to his luſts, or moſt conſiſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Such a notion of <hi>Faith</hi> we met withall before, and if there were not ſome other of <hi>Repentance,</hi> as eaſie; it were ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for men to perſwade themſelves, they have repented of their Sins, without any actual ſincere reformation of their lives; Or, to believe that the laſt hour of their lives is time enough for this work, when they know ſuch a reformation is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impoſſible.</p>

               </hi> caſe was indeed very miſerable; if we conſider a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:192161:75"/>repentance, wherein there ſeems to be a diſtinct example, of all three parts of the Scholaſtical repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As firſt, ſuch a deep <hi>Attrition,</hi> as, by the Pontifician Doctrin, ſeemed to want nothing, to have turned it into <hi>Contrition,</hi> but <hi>Abſolution;</hi> which, conſidering his free and particular <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> (the ſecond part of his Repentance) <hi>I have ſinned in betraying innocent blood;</hi> and that joyned with a voluntary <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> (the third part) in his <hi>bringing again the thirty pieces of ſilver</hi>) was unmercifully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him by the chief Prieſts.
<note place="margin">Matth. 27.3, 4, 5.</note> But <hi>Judas</hi> his conſcience could not be ſatisfied, much leſs his ſin diſcharged, with all this repentance; which yet was a great deal more than that which is commonly preſumed to be ſufficient. For moſt people think, if their conſciences be pricked with the ſenſe of their ſins, ſo that they can ſay they are ſorry for them, let it be upon what conſideration it will, they are truly penitent, eſpecially if this ſorrow be but diſtinguiſhed from that of <hi>Judas,</hi> by a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous hope and confidence of pardon. And much more, if they can but deceive themſelves, into a preſent ſleight purpoſe of ſome amendment of their lives: Then they think they are out of danger, and may build upon the promiſe of the Goſpel, for a certain Pardon. Whereas by the neceſſary ſenſe of this Text, it is perfectly evident, that the moſt ſincere ſorrow for ſin, is not, in it ſelf, a compleat repentance, but a cauſe, and a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to it: For, <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh repentance;</hi> But the cauſe, and the effect cannot be the ſame thing; nothing can produce it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But becauſe Godly ſorrow, if it be right, will
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:192161:76"/>work repentance, therefore it may in ſome caſe (where there is no time for any works to be brought forth) be accepted for Repentance, upon the ſame account, by which the will is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for the deed, when it is a ſincere, firm, and ratified Will; which God only can judg of, and which it is ſcarce poſſible for any man to know of himſelf, without ſome reaſonable trial.</p>
            <p>And therefore there is ſmall comfort for any man in a repentance that hath proceeded no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God may indeed ſee it to be ſincere without any triall, and therefore may accept it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to judge any ſuch Penitent, but leave him to the judgment of God, and hope the beſt. And ſo we may do in our own caſe; But we can have no better aſſurance of the validity of our repentance, than we have of the ſincerity of our own hearts, which are deceitfull above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>But, that Sorrow for ſin alone, is not repentance, may be confirmed by the forementioned wo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:192161:76"/>
            <p>I conclude therefore from the evidence of theſe Texts, that a bare ſorrow for ſin, is not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: much leſs is it a bare acknowledgment, or confeſſion of ſin, which may be without any ſuch ſorrow; and of it ſelf ſignifies no more than that a man hath cauſe to repent, not neceſſarily that he doth ſo: It imports a conviction of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ene, not any converſion of the will, For a man may acknowledge himſelf to have done evil; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intention of ceaſing from the practice: <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 27.3. Exod. 9.13. 10s 16. 1 Sam. 15.24.30.26.71.</note> did all confeſs they had ſinned but were no true penitents: There are none more impenitent, than many of them who make formal confeſſions of their ſins privately and publickly, oft enough. Papiſts have a general cuſtome to come to confeſſion once in a while, with ſome formal ſhews of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, whereupon of courſe they muſt be abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, without and before any other teſtimony of their repentance: And then they think they are clear with God Almighty for all that is paſt: and being ſo, they think they may make bold to run on the ſcore again for a time, with a purpoſe of acting over the ſame pennance again, when time ſerves for their new ſins. And this is taken by the vulgar people to be the buſineſs of repentance, ſufficient to ſave them; from <hi>Hell,</hi> at leaſt; though not from <hi>Purgatory:</hi> So that, if they be not preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at laſt (by ſudden death) of time or opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to act this repentance, they are ſafe enough, though they live in a courſe of ſin: And againſt that fear they have alſo this <hi>Salvo,</hi> that, if it ſhould ſo fall out, their intention and deſire of confeſſion
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:192161:77"/>ſhall be accepted for the deed. And this Doctrin wants nothing but the ſeal of Infallibility, to make it the moſt Comfortable to fleſh, and bloud, that can eaſily be invented: However, though it be no Article of Faith, yet it is ſafe enough to believe it, becauſe it wants not the warrant of <hi>a probable opinion,</hi> from the judgment of the Doctors that have taught it.</p>
            <p>But to make the worſt of it; how falſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious ſoever this Opinion, or Practice be, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as true, and as ſafe, as that which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed by us. The only difference is, that we have the advantage of them for eaſe; whiles we can excuſe our ſelves, of all their trouble and ſhame of confeſſing our ſins to a Prieſt, and ſatisfy our conſciences with doing it to God only, with as little ſincerity, and leſs regret, than they do to a man. For, what is more ordinary with us, than for people to make ſolemn Confeſſion of their ſins, joyntly in the publick Congregation, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, after a faſhion, in their private Devotions every day, and to ask God forgiveneſs, and then return to them again, as conſtantly as night and day, light and darkneſs, do ſucceed one another: As if it were a matter of courſe, as neceſſary for us to do, as to ſleep and wake. How many are they in both Churches, that doe perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the Duty of Repentance, is ſufficiently diſcharged, by ſuch a formal cuſtomary practice of confeſſion; which (ſo performed) is ſo far from the effect of a true Repentance (that is, from avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing towards the remiſſion of ſin) that it muſt needs be a great aggravation thereof: in aſmuch as it can ſignifie, before God, nothing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:192161:77"/>more than a continued practice of impudent hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. For what elſe can it be for a man daily to confeſſe his ſins, without any real deſire, purpoſe, or care to forſake them? And this hypocriſie is very much augmented by the formality of ſuch devout petitions as are uſually joyned with ſuch confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>viz.</hi> that God will <hi>grant them hereafter, to live a ſober, righteous, and godly life, to the glory of his holy name: and that the reſt of their life, hereafter may be pure and holy: that they may hereafter ſerve and pleaſe God in holineſs of life,</hi> and the like: which prayers going out of fained lips (as they muſt needs do, whiles the things prayed for, are neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, nor deſired) are turned into ſin: being an open flattering of God with their lips, whiles their hearts are far from him: What elſe can it be but a plain mocking of God, and taking his Holy Name in vain, for a man with ſuch ſeeming devotion, to pretend an humble, and earneſt deſire of his grace, to enable him to perform ſuch things as he never intends to go about? This Repentance therefore conſiſting only in ſuch formal confeſſions, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, is nothing but an addition to the ſin of the hypocritical penitents, and therefore far enough from the right notion <hi>of repentance to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But hitherto I have inſiſted only upon ſome groſs miſtakes about the matter of repentance, whith remain to be rectified by a right deſcription of the true nature of that duty: wherein, it muſt be acknowledged that the forementioned things (<hi>viz.</hi> ſorrow for ſin with confeſſion thereof to God) being ſuppoſed to be ſincere, and joyned with an unfained purpoſe of forſaking all known ſin in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:192161:78"/>the contrary practice of a holy life, are not only true and real parts of repentance, but do amount to the effect of a true repentance inchoate or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begun: whereunto nothing is wanting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the being of it, but the intire performance of ſuch a purpoſe, in the ſequel of a mans life: As may be learned from the words of the Baptiſt; <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi> and the like of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> preaching to the Gentiles, <hi>That they ſhould repent, and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance,</hi> Acts 26.20. Both which Texts do ſignifie, that repentance hath a kind of exiſtence (as it were in its root) antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the fruits, and works thereof. And the latter of them doth ſpecially declare wherein the true notion and nature thereof doth conſiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in turning unto God. <hi>Repent, and turn unto God;</hi> the latter phraſe is exegetical, declaring the ſenſe of the former. To repent is to turn unto God; which ſuppoſeth an averſion from God, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent condition, and poſture of every penitent ſinner. And ſo much is ſignified by the name of a ſinner; Sin being nothing elſe but an averſion or turning away from God.</p>
            <p>So that Repentance being the ſame thing with Converſion in Scripture-ſenſe, is a relative word, having a double tearm of relation, <hi>à quo</hi> &amp; <hi>ad quem, from which,</hi> and to <hi>which</hi> The latter is expreſſed by the Apoſtle in the forementioned words,

               <hi>Repent, and turn unto God.</hi> From whence it is called <hi>Repentance towards,</hi> or unto, <hi>God,</hi> Act. 20.21. The former is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>He.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Repentance from dead works,</hi> that is, from ſinful works, called dead works
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:192161:78"/>becauſe they are the acts of a man Spiritually dead and deſtitute of Spiritual, and Divine life. Theſe two things make up the intire ſignification of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>viz.</hi> turning from ſin as ſin, that is, all known ſin; unto God, that is, unto the univerſal duty of obedience unto his will: moſt fully and plainly expreſſed by the words of the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. <hi>But if the wicked man will turn from all his ſin which he hath committed, and keep all my ſtatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die,</hi> This I take to be one of the plaineſt, and compleateſt deſcriptions of Repentance which is to be found in Scripture: Wherein the ſame general duty is otherwiſe ſet forth, in great variety of expreſſion: As, <hi>to rent the heart, to circumciſe the foreskin of the heart, to abhor our ſelves, to ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well, To crucifie the old man, and the fleſh, to mortifie the deeds of the body; to cleanſe ourſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and to perfect holineſs in the fear of God; to put off the old man, and put on the new, to cleanſe our hands, and purifie our hearts, to deny all ungodlineſs, and wordly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world,</hi> &amp;c. Wherunto the general termes of Regeneration, Sanctification, and the new Creature, are materially equivalent.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many other expreſſions there are of the ſame general duty: all of them ſignifying an eſſiectuall change of the whole man, inward and out ward; beginning in the mind or underſtanding;

<note place="margin">Eph. 5.8. Heb. 6.4.</note> illumination, and inlightning: as, on the contrary, ſin is termed darkneſs very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Repentance comprehending the whole work of grace, is begun in the mind, but hath its moſt proper effect, and ſeat in the Will, as ſin alſo hath. It is the effectual, habitual, converſion of the Will that makes out a true Repentance; that being the only faculty which is capable of command, and moſt directly and immediatly obliged to obey, having alſo the power of commanding the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and actions of the whole man.</p>
            <p>And upon this account it is, that Sorrow for, and Confeſſion of ſin, do ſometimes ſignifie a true Repentance, having the promiſe of pardon annexed to them: becauſe where they are ſincere, they do infer ſuch a change in the Wil, as amounts to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. For a true godly ſorrow for ſin as offenſive to God and repugnant to his juſt and holy Will, cannot be ſeparated from a real purpoſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:192161:79"/>the ſin. Becauſe it is impoſſible for a man to be ſincerely ſorry for that which the Will allows, either as already done, or to be done hereafter. And therefore alſo ſuch confeſſion of ſin as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a godly ſorrow, doth neceſſarily imply a converſion or change of the Will; which if it be ſo radicated, and fixed, as will prove effectual up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the trial, (which God only knows) is nothing leſs than a true Repentance begun in the Heart. But this may ſeem more than enough, to have been ſpoken by way of Explication of ſo ordinary a Point: whereunto therefore I ſhall add no more in this place, but this one advertiſement, to apply it to my Text; That, ſeeing Repentance is a work of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation, whoſoever deſires <hi>to work out his own ſalvation,</hi> muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to work out his Repentance; which is done only by bringing forth fruits, or works, worthy of repentance: which can be no other than the works of a holy life: Seeing the work of Repentance can only be ſaid to be begun, by godly ſorrow, and confeſſion of ſin; and that only, when thoſe things are joyned with a firm and ſincere purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: it is evident that the entire duty can no otherwiſe be wrought out, than by a conſtant, and faithful performance of that godly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Having now laid down from Scripture the nature of Repentance, I come to the Anſwer of the Objection before mentioned, conſiſting of two Branches: 1. That the urged neceſſity of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the commandments, as part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the New covenant, deſtroies the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it from the Old: making both of them to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:192161:80"/>in theſe general terms of, <hi>Do this and live.</hi> And the conſequence of this, is 2. That the burthen, hereby laid upon Chriſtians, is intolerable, in as much as the keeping of the Commandments, is a yoak too heavy, for the ſhoulders of lapſed nature, though ſtrengthened by grace.</p>
            <p>My anſwer to this Objection, ſhall be grounded upon the Doctrin of Repentance, as that is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a peculiar precept, and priviledg of the New Covenant: Repentance (as hath been ſhewn) in the compleate ſenſe of the word, and extent of the duty, requires obedience to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (as Faith alſo doth); but not the ſame obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which the Law requireth. I ſay therefore, that repentance is a precept of the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and not of the firſt; a precept of the Goſpel, not of the Law, as ſuch: For <hi>to repent</hi> ſuppoſeth Sin, which by the condition of the firſt Covenant (ſuppoſed to be made with man-kind in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency) is indiſpenſably excluded: Repentance cannot become a duty, till a man hath broken the Law, and therefore cannot be a direct and abſolute precept of the Law: I ſay, a direct or abſolute precept of the Law in its prime intention, Repentance is not. But a conſequent hypothetical, indirect precept it is, of a ſecond intention. That is, upon ſuppoſition a man hath once tranſgreſſed the Law, he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly bound by the ſame Law to repent: as Repentance ſignifies a ceſſation from ſin, and a return to the duty of obedience. Otherwiſe a man might be diſcharged from the obligation of the Law by breaking it.
<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 1 Joh. 3.</note> And then he that had ſinned once, could ſin no more; becauſe, where there is no
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:192161:80"/>Law, there is no tranſgreſſion. But that Law that binds a man to perpetual obedience, doth not only bind a man from ſinning once; but, ſuppoſing that he hath done ſo, it muſt needs oblige him to ceaſe from continuing in his ſin; But properly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, Repentance is a precept of the Goſpel, directed to the tranſgreſſors of the Law, as a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the breach of it, and a condition of pardon, not allowed by the Original Law. And therefore, it is not a precept only, but a priviledg, peculiar to the Goſpel; being a gracious diſpenſation, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of the rigour of the Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18. <hi>God hath granted to the Gentiles repentance unto life.</hi> That a ſinner upon his repentance (through Faith in a Mediator that hath expiated his ſins) ſhould obtain remiſſion of his ſin, and be diſcharged from the penalty of the Law, is a new grant, grace, and priviledg of the ſecond Covenant.</p>
            <p>The difference therefore between the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> Covenant, lies not in the common ſenſe of thoſe general terms; <hi>Do this and live:</hi> as if the ſecond Covenant required nothing at all to be done (which is contrary to our Text and all thoſe which have been alledged for the explication thereof) but partly in the ſpecial ſignification of the Word <hi>this;</hi> and partly in a gracious promiſe of Grace, ſufficient to enable a man to perform what ever is to be underſtood by that word <hi>this;</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo interpreted as to ſignifie the ſame thing in reference to both Covenants: Becauſe, though <hi>ſomething</hi> be required to be done, as a Condition of the new Covenant, as well as of the old: yet <hi>not the ſame:</hi> For, ſomething was required in the <hi>old,</hi> which is not in the <hi>new,</hi> and ſomething is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:192161:81"/>in the <hi>new,</hi> which was not in the <hi>old:</hi> and ſomething is required in <hi>both.</hi> For inſtance; The old Covenant indiſpenſably required perfect inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, in an entire fulfilling the whole Law, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the heart of man, or declared (or to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) by divine Revelations; leaving no place for any ſuch thing as Repentance to be admitted for a Remedy of Sin: But, this perfect Innocence is ſo far from being required in the new Covenant, as the very <hi>Suppoſition</hi> of it prevents and deſtroyes the end and deſign of the New; which imports a plain contradiction to ſuch ſinleſs innocence: In as much as the new Covenant is nothing elſe but a Remedy provided by the grace of God, for the want of ſuch innocence: Were it poſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the condition of the old Covenant, the new could have no place: becauſe, that ſuppoſeth a man a tranſgreſſor of the old. And if now it were poſſible for any man to obey the whole Law, without any new tranſgreſſion, yet he that is already a ſinner,
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.18, 19.</note> (as all men are by the firſt tranſgreſſion) could not be ſaved by that Covenant, becauſe his being ſo, renders him incapable of pleading performance of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. This therefore is a main difference between the two Covenants. The <hi>firſt</hi> exacts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Innocence,</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> admits <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond difference of theſe Covenants, is in the firſt and principal Article of the new Covenant, which is conſigned, upon the Condition of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>a Saviour to ſave us from our Sins.</hi> Which alſo imports a plain Repugnance to the Condition of the firſt, in as much as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:192161:81"/>a violation of it. Faith in a Saviour, to ſave us from our Sins, could be no precept of the old Covenant; becauſe, that doth neither declare nor admit any ſuch Saviour. Theſe are two main things, whereby the two Covenants are diſtinguiſhed in their Conditions; and it is not requiſite in this place to name any more.</p>
            <p>But with theſe Differences, there is alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing common to both: and that is, the general Obligation of Obedience to the Commandments, according to the expreſs words of our Saviour before alledged: <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments:</hi> And this I take to be a duty of ſuch neceſſity, as could not be diſcharged or diſpenſed with by any poſitive Will, or Covenant of God, upon any Conſideration whatſoever: No not upon that of a moſt perfect <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for the breach of the Law, with an intire fulfilling of it by a Surety, for, and in the ſtead of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors: I ſay, that neither upon this, nor any other Conſideration, the Duty of Obedience to the Moral Law of God, could be diſcharged, or diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with: For theſe Reaſons;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſuch a diſcharge or diſpenſation, is contrary to the Soveraignty of God, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth an Authority to command all Creatures that are capable of receiving, and obeying any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. This Authority being eſſential to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, He cannot deveſt himſelf of, by any poſitive Will, no more than he can deſtroy his own Eſſence: But, to diſcharge a Creature ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the duty of Obedience, from all obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereunto, were to put off that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; becauſe, Where there is no obligation to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:192161:82"/>obedience, there can be no authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. If therefore God ſhould diſcharge a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his duty of Obeying his Commands, he ſhould thereby quit his Soveraignty over that Creature, which is altogether impoſſible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe ſuch a liberty granted to any part of mankind, is contrary to the Juſtice, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, in as much as it implies a licence, and toleration of the utmoſt wickedneſs, that could be committed by them that had obtain'd this liberty: For, where there is no reſtraint put upon the wills of men by any binding law, there muſt needs be the utmoſt of licenſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe this Liberty is contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Man,</hi> as he is a <hi>Reaſonable Creature.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as he is reaſonable, he is capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Commands, and Laws from his Creator; and as he is a Creature, he is naturally bound to be ſubject to them: The relation of a Creature natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally importing ſuch a debt of ſubjection to the Creator, as can never be diſcharged;</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, Becauſe there are ſome Divine Laws which are in themſelves indiſpenſable to a reaſonable Creature: Such is that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Moral Law, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, ſignifying (not all Precepts, that concern the manners of men, but) the ſame thing with the Law of Nature, and right Reaſon; Which, as it teacheth a diſtinction of Good and Evil, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the nature of ſome actions, antecedent to any poſitive or expreſs Law of God or man, ſo doth it indiſpenſably oblige to the practical obſervation thereof.

That which is in it ſelf Evil cannot without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction become indifferent, or lawful; But that which is not reſtrained, or forbidden by any binding Law, muſt needs be lawful. Therefore the opinion of <hi>Libertines,</hi> and <hi>Antinomians,</hi> affirming <hi>Chriſtians</hi> under the Goſpel, to be diſcharged from the duty of Obedience, to any Law or Command of God, as ſuch; is not only falſe and heretical, but alſo impoſſible to be true: in as much as it imports a repugnancy to the nature both of God and man, and all diſtinction of Good and Evil; and withall it evacuates all pardon of ſin, by concluding an impoſſibility of committing it: For, where no Law is, there can be no Tranſgreſſion: I conclude therefore, that the duty of Obedience to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, is common to both Covenants: And that when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We are not under the Law, but under Grace,</hi> Rom. 6.15. his meaning cannot be, that we are not under any Obligation of the Law, but that we are not under the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Exaction of the Law, requiring perfect obedience, without affording either pardon, for any Offences againſt it, or any ſufficient aid of Grace to perform it. Chriſtians by the Covenant of Grace, which now they are under, are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from that deſperate ſtate, which the Law leaves them in, that are under it; being relieved by a double Grace, firſt of pardon of Sin upon Repentance; and ſecondly of ability through the aſſiſtance of God's Spirit, to yield ſuch obedience to the Law, as will be accepted.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:192161:83"/>
            <p>And ſo to the Objection of the <hi>burthen of that Obedience,</hi> which by the premiſſes hath been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted neceſſary to Salvation, I anſwer; That God's accepting (by the new Covenant) <hi>Repentance,</hi> joyned with <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt, inſtead of <hi>perfect Obedience</hi> required in the old, is a ſufficienu abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the intolerableneſs of the old yoke, and as ample a diſpenſation, as could be afforded to Sinners, to qualifie them for ſalvation: which will further appear upon theſe Conſiderations;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Repentance (ſuppoſing men to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) admitted by the Covenant of Grace for the Condition of Salvation, affords a remedy for Sin, and a capacity of Life, to them that by the old Covenant are abſolutely excluded from all hopes thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Reformation of life and future obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which Repentance ſignifies, is not the ſame which the Law exacts; that is, not abſolute, and perfect, without any manner of defect. Not the not-ſinning at all, but the not wilfully, and preſumptuouſly ſinning, and abiding therein im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently, after the <hi>receiving

                     </gap>.</note> the knowledge</hi> (or acknowledgment) <hi>of the truth,</hi> Heb. 10.26. A ſincere deſire, and faithful indeavour of obedience, is accepted for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: which may conſiſt with ſome ſuch things as the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns; as, ſins of ignorance (not affected,) ſins of Infirmity, and ſurreption, Imperfection in the performance of duty, ſincerely indeavoured; with many frailties, which a Chriſtian labours under, and againſt, but cannot perfectly overcome. Such things as theſe, although as tranſgreſſions of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:192161:83"/>pure and perfect Law of God, they have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin, yet by the tenor of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and through the mercy of God in Chriſt the Mediator thereof, they ſhall not be imputed to the penitent ſinner, that by a true Faith layes hold upon that Mediator. So that there be ſome ſins which do not make void the effect, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Repentance, but are conſiſtent with the truth of it, and a regenerate ſtate.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it is difficult to determine preciſely and excluſively what they are, it concerns every true penitent, to take as much heed as he can, of all ſin, and not to preſume of any indulgence, for the leaſt, that can be avoided by him; And whiles it is ſaid that ſome kinds of ſin, are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with ſuch a Repentance, as is available to ſalvation, it is implyed that others are not ſo; and ſuch are all groſs, wilful, and preſumptuous ſins. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither do ſuch ſins as theſe, after a man hath once truly repented, exclude a ſinner, from the benefit of the Goſpel: But are ſtill capable of the ſame remedie, which is allowed for all ſorts of ſin, which a man is found guilty of before his firſt Converſion: Although ſuch ſins do evacuate the benefit of his former repentance, ſo far as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him uncapable of expecting, or claiming the Remiſſion of them thereby, ſuſpending his pardon for the preſent, till he hath renewed his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or repaired the breach of it. Herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the abundance of Goſpel-grace, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of repentance, that it is never out-dated; not being reſtrained to one general pardon, (as the <hi>Novatians</hi> heretically taught) nor limited to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:192161:84"/>any number of Repetitions. There is no ſin at any time unpardonable under the Condition of Repentance; For that againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is ſuppoſed to be ſo, upon this account only, that it excludes that Grace, by which a man ſhould be inabled to repent.</p>
            <p>Theſe three things (relating to the doctrine of Repentance) duly conſidered, I conceive to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to anſwer the Objection before ſuggeſted. Eſpecially if that be added which I take to be agreeable to the doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>viz,</hi> That whoſoever imbraceth this ſecond Covenant, ſhall be ſufficiently inabled by the grace thereof, that is, by the Spirit of Chriſt that helps him, (though not to keep the whole Law exactly, and perfectly without ſin, yet) to do all things which by that Covenant are required of him to work out his own ſalvation. This ſufficiency of Grace, I take to be ſuppoſed in the Exhortation of my Text, and confirmed by the Reaſon that follows after it. <hi>For it is God that worketh in you to will, and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> Of which, afterward.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have proceeded towards the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of that great Queſtion <hi>(What is to be done by him, that deſires to work out his own ſalvation)</hi> from the diſtinct Anſwer of our bleſſed Saviour, and two of his Apoſtles, to the ſame Queſtion. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Lord Jeſus,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul; Repent,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter; Keep the Commandments,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. Theſe three Anſwers, comprehending whatever is required of a Chriſtian, in order to his ſalvation, might ſuffice for a complete Anſwer, to that Queſtion. But conſidering the infinite weight and moment of the Queſtion, ſome further

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:192161:86"/>outward worſhip, both private and publick. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto agrees that of S. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> And a compleat paraphraſe of that Text, we have in the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1 <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes (dearly beloved) let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh, and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is promiſed in the Goſpel, under conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſanctification; 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. And is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no otherwiſe to be wrought out, than by a through cleanſing of our ſelves, from all kinds and degrees of pollution, both of Soul and body, as far as is poſſible, and labouring to perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the fear of God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall mention but one Text more, by way of general Direction, what a Chriſtian ſhould do to work out his own Salvation: and that ſhall be from the Apoſtle: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Therefore my beloved brethren be ye ſtedfaſt, and unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> The word <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> referrs to the precedent diſcourſe, that takes up the whole chapter, containing an ample confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and explication of that grand Article of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the Reſurrection of the Faithfull to Everlaſting life, and the final accompliſhment of their Salvation from ſin, and death: The truth of which Doctrine, to him that believes it, affords an argument, abundantly ſufficient to perſwade and incourage him, to all that may be neceſſary, or profitable to the attaining unto this bleſſed eſtate, wherein his labour will be ſo fully recompenced. And therefore together with this argument, from
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:192161:86"/>the certainty of the reward, the Apoſtle concludes his diſcourſe, with ſpecial directions how it is to be attained: ſhewing, 1. What that work is, which is to be done to this end, 2. How it is to be perſued. <hi>viz.</hi> with all conſtancy, and diligence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſheweth what that work is, which is to be done by him that looketh for this reward. It muſt be <hi>the work of the Lord:</hi> and what's that? our Saviour hath told us in the Text before quoted: <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe on him, whom he hath ſent.</hi> But this Faith, as hath been declared, doth not exclude other works, but neceſſarily require them, as it's effects, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents. By <hi>the work of the Lord,</hi> therefore, muſt certainly be underſtood, all manner of good works, that is, all ſuch as are agreeable to the known Will of the Lord. For albeit no man may expect to be ſaved by, or for, any merit of his works: yet the Scripture frequently declareth that every man ſhall be judged by and according to his works. And though Faith be the prime condition of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and gives a man a title to Salvation; yet is this title to be held under the Condition of good works, without which this Right cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Becauſe ſuch a Faith as gives this right cannot be maintained without them:
<note place="margin">Jam. 2.14.22.</note> For <hi>Faith without works is dead:</hi> that is ineffectual and vain. <hi>What will it profit a man to ſay he hath Faith and have not works?</hi> Can Faith ſave him? No, <hi>for Faith is made perfect</hi> (that is, effectual and ſaving) <hi>by works:</hi> To work out a mans Salvation then, is to do all manner of good works that are in his power, and to abſtain from evil, upon a principle of Faith in the Lord Jeſus,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:192161:87"/>working by love. And this muſt needs be all that can be done by a Chriſtian in order to this end: Provided that this work be perſued in ſuch manner, as is directed by the Apoſtle's Exhortation, in the firſt words: <hi>Be ye ſtedfaſt, and unmoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abounding in the work of the Lord:</hi> wherein two things are preſcribed concerning the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this duty; the firſt is Conſtancy, expreſſed in three words <hi>ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is Diligence, and Zeal ſignified by the word, <hi>abounding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>to be ſtedfaſt and unmoveable,</hi> is, <hi>to ſtand faſt in the Faith:</hi> and to be conſtant in <hi>the work of Faith.</hi> And ſo much is implied in the word <hi>work out</hi> your own Salvation, which (as before was obſerved) ſuppoſeth the work already begun, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to be perfected, by a continued perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, whereunto only the promiſe of Salvation is made: <hi>He that endureth to the end, ſhall be ſaved, Mat.</hi> 10.22. And when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God will render to every man according to his works,</hi> he interprets himſelfs in the next words, <hi>To them that by patient continuing in well-doing, ſeek for glory and honour, and immortality,</hi> (God will render) <hi>eternallife.</hi> Ro. 2.6, 7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He that will work out this end, is adviſed by the Apoſtle to labour to <hi>abound in the work of the Lord;</hi> which is the ſame thing that S. <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth us, when he exhorts to <hi>give diſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> (by good works) <hi>to make our calling and election ſure:</hi> And though the abounding in good works, be not abſolutely neceſſary to the attaining of Salvation, as it is to the qualifying a man for the Degrees of the reward; yet it is, without doubt, the ſafeſt courſe to ſecure the Title it ſelf: which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:192161:87"/>a few good works, with the neglect of others, will not do. <hi>If theſe things be in you and abound</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Peter) they make you that ye ſhall neither be barren nor unfruitful.</hi> A field or tree is judged barren and unfruitfull, though it doth bear ſome fruit (as ſuppoſe, there and there, an ear of Corn or an Apple) if there be no proportion between the ground, or the tree with the reſpective coſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them, and the crop that they yield: So certainly will men be judged, by the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ablities that God affords them, to their good works; elſe, almoſt every man would be ſaved; becauſe there is ſcarce any man ſo bad, but he doth or hath done ſome good works, at leaſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially good,</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn at large from Holy Scripture only, what that work is by which our Salvation is to be wrought out: and ſhall finiſh my Anſwer to that Queſtion, with the addition of one Advertiſement more: which is, that, none of this work can be done, without the aſſiſtance of Divine Grace, as we are taught by the words immediately following my Text; <hi>For, it is God that worketh in you to will, and to doe, of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:</hi> of which ſomething more afterward; At preſent, I only obſerve this conſequence from them, agreeable to the queſtion in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> That, ſeeing there is ſuch an abſolute neceſſity of Gods Grace to the performance of this work, it follows, that, Whatſoever is neceſſary to obtain this Grace, muſt be equally neceſſary to work out our own Salvation. Seeing therefore that Prayer, Hearing, Reuding and Meditating on Gods word, and the frequent participation of the Holy Euchariſt,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:192161:88"/>or Supper of the Lord, are the ordinary means, inſtituted by God for the obtaining of his grace, it is neceſſary, that a Chriſtian ſhould diligently apply himſelf to the practice of theſe duties, not only as good works, but as the means of grace to inable him to do what ever elſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him to work out his Salvation. But of theſe things more hereafter, in the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the third Queſtion; <hi>viz.</hi> What is meant by thoſe words <hi>with

Theſe words are added to expreſſe the manner of the performance of this duty: And it is not to be imagined that there is any material difference in the ſenſe of theſe two words, though the latter of them, doth properly ſignifie the effect the former:

                  <hi>Chryſt.</hi>
               </note> For, <hi>Trembling is the effect of fear.</hi> But here, they are no other than Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous expreſſions; the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe whereof, is only to fortifie, and urge the ſame ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The meaning of the words will beſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, partly from the oppoſites of ſuch a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is thereby ſignified, and partly from the uſe of the ſame words in other Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now the direct Oppoſites of <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trembling,</hi> are <hi>preſumption,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-confidence,</hi> or vain confidence, together with

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:192161:88"/>and ſo ſigniſies humility, modeſtie, and reverence. From an humble ſenſe of our own weakneſs, apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to neglect, and inability to perform this work, without the ſpecial aſſiſtance of divine grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20: <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>And without doubt a ſecond thing ſignified by this fear and trembling,
<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </note> is <hi>diligence, care, and ſollicitude,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the due apprehenſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, of the infinite weight, and moment of this work, in order to its end; as alſo, of the difficulty of performing it by reaſon of our own weakneſs, and the many impediments, we have from the Devil and the world in the perſuance thereof. Theſe two things, <hi>humble reverence,</hi> and <hi>diligent caution,</hi> are ſignified by the ſame words, uſed by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Epheſ. 6.5. <hi>Servants be obedient to them that are your Maſters according to the fleſh, with fear and trembling, in ſingleneſs of heart, as unto Chriſt;</hi> i. e. with a careful reverence (not a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear); and with an honeſt ſollicitous dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and caution, leſt they ſhould offend or diſpleaſe, neglect or do any thing amiſs: So, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Titus</hi> bears witneſs to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> of the ready
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:192161:89"/>obedience of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to his Orders, and how they had <hi>received him, with fear and trembling;</hi> that is, with all reverence, carefulneſs, deſire and zeal, to approve themſelves unto him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. So are the ſame words to be underſtood in our Text: <hi>Work out your own Salvation, with fear and trembling;</hi> that is, with all humility and reverence, in dependance upon God's grace, not truſting to your own power and ability, and yet doing your duty with all care and diligence.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe are many Precepts, and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of our Saviour and the Apoſtles, agreeable: to be here added; not ſo much to confirm the Obligation, as to preſs the Performance of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Duty.

And 2. The neceſſity of this Labour, is urged from the ſtraitneſs of the Gate, <hi>i. e.</hi> the difficulty of Entrance into Life. And 3. from the Miſcarriage, and ill ſucceſs of many that ſeek to enter, who through preſumption or negligence, (the oppoſites of this Fear, and Trembling) ſhall not be able to enter. <hi>Let us therefore fear</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it:</hi> Heb. 4.1.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:192161:89"/>A gracious Promiſe is left us, in the Goſpel, of a bleſſed Reſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> promiſed to the Iſraelites, towards which they were led by the Conduct of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in a laborious March through the Wilderneſs; repreſenting the Race, or Life of a Chriſtian, through the Deſart of this World, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct of Chriſt, the Captain of our Salvation. But, as then it fell out, that many that were brought out of Egypt, carried through the Red Sea, and led on the way towards the Land of Promiſe; fell ſhort of Entring, through their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and Diſobedience: So doth it come to paſs, that many that have received the Promiſe in the Goſpel of entring into the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and are brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (the ſtate of Bondage under Sin, and Death) through the Water of holy Baptiſm (figured by the Red Sea) by which they are ſaved, that is, put into a way of Salvation, will at laſt fall ſhort of obtaining this Promiſe by the ſame Unbelief, and Diſobedience. And ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Fallers there are, that there will be few left at laſt, to enter into that Reſt: becauſe there are indeed very few that will take the pains to work out their own Salvation, begun by their Baptiſm.

            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was not without this ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Fear, or Care, when he ſaid, <hi>I keep under my Body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a Caſt-away,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. And when he uſed thoſe anxious words, <hi>If by any means I may attain unto the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> (i. e. the Reſurrection of the Juſt) <hi>Not as though I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained, either were already perfect; But I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after, if that I may apprehend that for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus. Bretheren, I count not my ſelf to have apprehended; But this one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, I preſs towards the mark, for the prize of the high Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 3.11, 12, 13, 14. Thus doth the holy Apoſtle teſtifie his preſſing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, labour, and ſollicitude, that he uſed, to ſave his own Soul, when he had already as much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of it, as is to be had on this ſide Heaven: And if ſo much labour was ſtill neceſſary for him, (as ſure it was, except we will ſay, it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pains that he took) is it not at leaſt as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us? Shall we preſume of gaining the Prize, with more eaſe than he durſt truſt to? Was he ſuperſtitious? or ignorant of the free grace of God, and the terms of Salvation? I will conclude with the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. <hi>If ye call on the Father, who without reſpect of perſons, judgeth every man according to his works, paſs the time of your ſojourning here in Fear.</hi> Great reaſon there is that they that call God Father, ſhould be careful, as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:192161:90"/>obedient Children, to be <hi>holy in all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, as he is holy,</hi> v. 15. And ſhould walk re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently, ſtrictly, and watchfully, all the time of their Sojourning in this World: knowing that God doth, and will finally judge every man according to his works: leſt if they ſhould be found careleſs and negligent in the work of the Lord, they ſhould receive that ſevere Sentence of the wicked and ſlothful Servant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.26.30. <hi>Caſt ye the unprofitable Servant into utter darkueſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now omitting all other Texts of Scripture, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the many Reaſons that might, (and ſhall afterward in the Application) be added, I ſhall here take up with the ſpecial Reaſon, which is annexed by the Apoſtle in the words next after my Text. <hi>For, it is God that worketh in you to will and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi> Which words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added by the Apoſtle, by way of Argument or Reaſon, to inforce the premiſed Exhortation, are ſo to be interpreted as will beſt agree with the Scope and Intention thereof: And therefore are not to be underſtood in ſuch a ſenſe, as deſtroyes the freedom of the Will, in regenerate perſons, to whom only the Exhortation is directed: For that would make void the Exhortation, as St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> argues upon the Text. For if it be ſo, that the Whole Work is done by God, irreſiſtibly, without any liberty left to our Wills, to neglect it, why are we exhorted to do it our ſelves? If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done in this Work, without irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible Grace; then nothing, that can be done, can be neglected: No more good can be done by any Chriſtian than is done; nor, no leſs.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:192161:91"/>
            <p>But I have no diſpoſition to enter upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, raiſed about the ſenſe of theſe Words: But ſhall plainly, and briefly declare, what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the ſcope, and meaning of them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the antecedent Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Therefore ought we to work out our own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling, that is, with an humble dependence upon God, and with a diligent care to accept and improve his Grace; becauſe, <hi>It is God that worketh in us to will and to do, of his good pleaſure:</hi> i. e. 'Tis he, (not only that begins this work in us, by his preventing Grace, whereby we are at firſt converted, and effectually called, but) that carries it on,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note> and inables us to <hi>work it out,</hi> by his co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Graces: So that it is certain, we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without his Grace; which he gives to the humble, <hi>i. e.</hi> to them that are ſenſible of their need of it, and depend upon him for it, with fear to want it by their neglect of it. And though the <hi>firſt Grace</hi> which is the Seed of God, by which we are Regenerated, and called to believe, be given abſolutely, without any Condition; yet, <hi>additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal grace,</hi> whereby our Salvation is to be wrought out, is not promiſed without the Condition of Improvement of that Grace, which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received. According to the words of our Saviour. <hi>To him that hath,</hi> (i. e. improveth his Talent which he hath freely received) <hi>ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he ſhall have abundance; But from him that hath not</hi> (i. e. that doth not ſo) <hi>ſhall be taken away, even that which he hath.</hi> Matth. 25.29. Seeing therefore, that without the grace of God, we can do no good Work, much leſs work out our own
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:192161:91"/>Salvation; It behoves us to take heed of Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and Self-confidence, that we do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly truſt to our ſelves, and our own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but labour for the grace of God: <hi>Whereby we may ſerve him acceptably with reverence and godly fear.</hi> Secondly, of Sloth and Negligence, that we <hi>receive not the grace of God in vain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.11.

            <p>So theſe words do afford a juſt and weighty Reaſon, why we ſhould work out our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>fear and trembling;</hi> becauſe it is <hi>God's Work,</hi> not only as commanded by him, (which is one reaſonable Conſideration to move us to a reverend diligence in the performance) but alſo as it is to be effected by his ſpecial Grace, without which, it can never be done.</p>

               </gap> cark, and care, and drudg to get wealth? The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious man to get honour? The voluptuons man to ſatisfie his brutiſh ſenſual appetite? Whiles this ſpiritual eternal Intereſt is ſo generally neglected as if it were a matter of no valuable concernment. Whereas no common notion, or principle of truth can be more evident, than this is, That this Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (if men admit the truth of it) is the only true, and ſupream intereſt of a man, as a Man. The common intereſt of all Creatures, is, Their ſafety, and welfare. Now, who is there, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, and believes any thing meant by this term of Salvation, that doth not know that it is that wherein conſiſts his only poſſible ſafetie, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? There are indeed ſome other petty points of temporal ſafety, and content, in this world; which ſome men call <hi>happineſs.</hi> But in truth, he deſerves not the name of a Man, much leſs of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that doth think his chiefeſt Good can conſiſt in any thing that this world can afford: Nay that doth not conſider (which is ſomthing more than to know) the notorious vanity of all this worlds goods, both in regard of the imperfection of the matter of them, and in reſpect of the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the duration; Who doth not know, that it is utterly impoſſible to ſecure his temporal injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for any definite time, though never ſo ſhort? But if that could be, it is not poſſible for any man of the largeſt fancy in the world, to name, ſet down, or imagin what portion of worldly things, would fully content him: ſo that if he could work out the obtainment thereof, his deſires

               </gap>ires, than a pint of water would be to fill up the whole channel of the Sea; or to ſatisfie the thirſt of the droughty Earth. On the other ſide, he that believes the Goſpel, cannot but believe that this <hi>Salvation,</hi> once effectually <hi>wrought out</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſecures a man from all poſſibilities of evil, and brings with it as perfect a fulneſs of happineſs as the nature of Man is capable of: and that this ſafety, and happineſs, in this ſtate of Salvation once poſſeſſed, is ſecured to Eternity, beyond any fear of mutation. And is it not then a ſtupendious piece of irrationality, for any man that knows, and believes all this, to neglect the working of it out? that is, either not at all to regard it, or to make it no more than a meer by-buſineſs, the leaſt part of his care! Yet, what is more common than this extremity of folly, even amongſt them, who are not the worſt of Chriſtians?</p>
            <p>When they go about any thing towards this end, how pitifully do they go to work? Inſtead of this fear and trembling, this ſpiritual ſhaking palſy, they are poſſeſſed with a <hi>torpedo,</hi> a dead palſy; or numbneſſe, as if every faculty of the Soul and Body were crampt. When they come to hear the Goſpel of Salvation, and to receive inſtruction how to work it out, which is the main end and ſcope of our preaching; what lazy, liſtleſs, yawning poſtures do they appear in? How wearily do
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:192161:96"/>they ſit? If they pray, how cold, heartleſs, and Zeal-leſs, is their formal devotion? If they give Alms how penurious, how degenerous is their charity? Notwithſtanding that the Author of this Salvation, hath ſo frequently and particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed this, as a ſpecial means of working out ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Salvation: Yet except men can find out ſome other end, advantage or motive for their charity, what a poor pittance is it that they will part with upon this deſign?</p>
            <p>When men are frequently admoniſhed, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and perſwaded, by the moſt powerfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of Gods word, to the duties of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſelf-denial, watchfulneſs, holineſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; how will they ſtrain their wits, to invent excuſes, and pretences to evade the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of theſe practices?
<q>There is nothing that we have ſo perfectly learned from our firſt Parens, as the art of excuſing our ſelves from our <hi>Duties,</hi> and our <hi>Sins,</hi> Nothing that men ſo vehemently deſire, as to evade the power of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace when it makes towards their Souls, by the preaching of the Word. When the holy Ghoſt makes towards them to overſhadow them, to the end, that Chriſt might be conceived, and formed in them, How ſtrongly is he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted? How does the harlot mind ſtrive to prevent the conception of Grace, or to force abortion? Such a deſperate averſneſs there is in the Carnal mind, to the kindneſs of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, flying from his approaches, loathing his imbraces, deſpiſing his allurements, ſleighting his rich preſents, and bountifull promiſes, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt all his importunities.</q> Whereas let
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:192161:96"/>but the unclean Spirit come with any ſleight tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to corrupt and deflowr the Soul; no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Strumpet is ſo ready to proſtitute her body, as the carnal man is to abandon his Soul to the luſts of the Devil.</p>
            <p>And what is the reaſon, why the ſpiritual, and heavenly promiſes of the Goſpel are ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed? Why! There is a double prejudice, which the nature of all men hath againſt them: 1. Becauſe they are promiſes of <hi>future</hi> Happineſs. 2, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Happineſſe is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are but promiſes of Happineſs to come in another world, and thoſe generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with ſome variety of preſent injoyments in this world; which muſt be relinquiſhed, either in whole or in part, by him that will build his hope upon thoſe promiſes. Without doubt, the conſideration, which ſo much abates the ſenſe that carnal men have, both of that extremity of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is threatned, and alſo of all that Felicity which is promiſed in another world, is the <hi>futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of both, at ſuch an uncertain diſtance of time. And conſequently, this is one of the chiefeſt reaſons of all that ſtupidity, which is ſhewn in their ſo great neglect of this Salvation. So impotently childiſh, and ſottiſh are the paſſions of men, that a dram of preſent pleaſure, appears more valuable to them than a thouſand talents of future gain: which is a judgment ſo perfectly brutiſh, as deſerves not to be confuted by ſober Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An other Prejudice that carnal men have againſt the promiſes of the Goſpel, is from the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of them, which is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and heavenly; have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:192161:97"/>nothing of the Turkiſh carnal Paradiſe in it: Nothing that fleſh and bloud, the habitual ſinner, can tell what to make of. Thoſe high raiſed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Beatifical Viſion, <hi>the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> heavenly glory, <hi>the Crown of life, and thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt fits at the right hand of God,</hi> are things that have no juice, no taſte in them to carnal minds; who are not eaſily brought to underſtand, or believe, there can be any true felicity, or pleaſure, in any thing which is not carnal and ſenſual. But this is not only an infallible Symptom of Infidelity, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Sottiſhneſs, beneath that of the better ſort of Epicureans.</p>
            <p>There is yet one branch of Reprehenſion remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that belongs to the <hi>preſumptuous.</hi> The perſons I have hitherto been ſpeaking of, are ſuch as do either obſtinately oppoſe, or wretchedly neglect this duty; as not having it in deſign, to work out their own Salvation: and ſo are moſt directly peccant againſt the <hi>matter</hi> of this precept. But there are others no leſs to be reproved for their deficiency in the manner of performing it: Being ſuch as do indeed project, and expect to be ſaved, but are extreamly far from any ſuch thing, as that fear and trembling which the Text requires. But inſtead of that, they are tranſported with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous confidences and vain hopes, built upon the ſands of their own Imaginations, promiſing themſelves to be ſaved upon far eaſier terms than thoſe which from the Goſpel have been declared. As upon a meer idle fruitleſs faith, that is, either an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical dogmatical beleif, of the truth of the Goſpel of Chriſt, that indeed there was, and yet is ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:192161:97"/>as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that he was a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſent from God, and the Meſſiah, the Son of God; and that which is written of him in the Goſpel is no fable, but real truth: (Some of which things are as well believed by Turks, and all by the Devil, more effectually, than by them; for <hi>the Devils believe and tremble):</hi> Or elſe, nothing but a certain fiducial confidence in Chriſt as a Saviour only, without regarding him as a Lord, or having any reſpect to his precepts, as of any neceſſity to Salvation: Hereupon they never doubt of their Salvation; or, if they do againſt their wills, they account it their greateſt ſin, as if it were indeed no leſs than the doubting the truth of Gods promiſes. This hath been taught by many, to be the only true juſtifying ſaving Faith: And no wonder that men have been apt to entertain ſuch an eaſie Doctrine; and that, having entertained it, they are carried away with preſumption, to think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe of neceſſity required to qualifie them for Salvation. Certainly, fleſh and blood cannot wiſh an eaſier way to Heaven than this is. But this error, in them that can and do read or hear the Scriptures of the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, (as well as the <hi>Old</hi>) can be no other than willfully affected. There being ſo many hundred Texts of the ſame Scriptures, (altogether as clear and poſitive as any that can ſeem to favour this Doctrin) that require other conditions and qualifications for Salvation, than that of Faith: beſides many that do ſufficiently declare that this is not the Faith to which Salvation is any where promiſed. I ſay hundreds of Texts are found in Scripture, which do as plainly and as poſitively (as is poſſible) declare
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:192161:98"/>that <hi>Repentance,</hi> Holineſs of Life, Mortification of fleſhly Luſts, with all Duties of Piety, and Love to God and our Neighbour, are Conditions of Salvation, no leſs neceſſary, and indiſpenſable than <hi>Faith</hi> is; And many Texts (before alledged) that do clearly ſhew the true juſtifying Faith, to be no other than ſuch, as works all theſe things in the unfeigned Believer, and therefore compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends them all in thoſe Texts where it is made the ſole Condition of Salvation. Faith <hi>that purifies the heart, that overcomes the World, that is obedient to Chriſt:</hi> If theſe Texts be as good Goſpel, and as Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, as any of thoſe which make mention of Faith alone, without any additions, or interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; what can it be but wilful preſumption, to expect Salvation upon ſuch a Faith, as is not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe Conditions?</p>
            <p>Others there are, who do quit themſelves of all this fear and trembling, all the ſollicitude which the Text requires, upon a ſummary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and Confidence of God's mercy. Let their Lives be what they will, God is merciful they are ſure, eſpecially to ſuch as truſt in him, and that they are reſolved to do, whatever Duty elſe they neglect. And though they do not deny his Juſtice, yet they will hope in his Mercy, <hi>even againſt Hope.</hi> And why may not the Devil do ſo too, if he could? Doth not he know that God is merciful? O but he knows, He will not be ſo to him! And how doth he know that? Hath he any greater aſſurance of it, than this Revelation of his Will? And is not his Word ſo? Yet, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe, that God will be ſo ſevere in his Laſt Judgment, as he ſeems to be in his Threatnings:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:192161:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>but <hi>that his tender Mercies,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.9.</note> are above all</hi> his Word, as well as <hi>his Works;</hi> That he is more merciful, than not to ſave his own Creature; though he ſaith the contrary: <hi>(He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them,
<note place="margin">Iſai. 27.11.</note> will ſhew them no favour;)</hi> more merciful than juſt, or true, or holy; more merciful in his Deeds, than true in his Words. That he doth not mean as he ſaith (though he ſwear to it) when he threatens damnation to men,
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.11.18, 19.</note> and that they ſhall <hi>never enter into his Reſt.</hi> Divers other grounds there are of Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby wretchleſs Souls (in favour of the Fleſh, to eaſe themſelves of the Yoke, as well of the Goſpel, as of the Law) are wilfully deceived. Such are all ſingle Inſtances of partial Vertue, as Temperance, Continence, juſt Dealing, ſome Works of pretended Charity, ſome particular practices of External Piety; an outward Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion, ſiding with Parties, Forms of Godlineſs, without the power thereof: Freedom from ſome kinds of groſs Vices, that others live in: The Phariſee's plea, <hi>They are not as other men are, Extortioners, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, Adulterers, &amp;c.</hi> they are no Murtherers, Thieves, common Drunkards; no Hereticks, nor Schiſmaticks, nor Rebels, &amp;c: And what then? Why, without doubt (if they ſay true) they ſhall not be damned for any of theſe Vices; And therefore they ſhall be ſaved. <hi>They Faſt and give Tithes, and Alms too,</hi> (yet have no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3.) as did the Phariſee: And ſhall not they be ſaved? No, ſurely, if our Saviour muſt be the Judge, and will keep to his Word: <hi>For I
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:192161:99"/>ſay unto you,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that except your Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall conclude my Application, with a ſerious endeavour to give force and efficacy to the Exhortation of my Text; firſt by ſome powerful Arguments; Secondly, by ſome general Directions, for the practice of this ſo important a Duty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the Arguments, or Motives; whereof the firſt is to be drawn from the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the infinite Concernment of this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. The infinite weight, worth, and moment of this End, hath been already declared in the beginning of this Diſcourſe, in anſwer to the firſt Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> What this Salvation means. And the ſumme of the Anſwer, collected from divers Deſcriptions thereof in Scripture, amounted to this; That it could ſignifie no leſs than, firſt, a Deliverance from the greateſt Evil; and ſecondly, an Obtainment of the higheſt Perfection of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that the nature of man is capable of: And this I call, an infinite Concernment, without an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> becauſe in the extenſion of it, it is no leſs; as being <hi>Eternal,</hi> in both parts; a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from Everlaſting Death, unto an Eternal Life. Now it being perfectly reaſonable that the intention of mens Affections, ſhould be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the real value of their Objects; it follows, that that ſolicitude &amp; care, which the Text requires (though it cannot ſo much exceed that which we have for other things, as the worth of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject doth, becauſe we have no Capacity of ſuch an Exceſs; yet that it) ſhould really and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:192161:99"/>ſurpaſs all other Cares. And, if it doth not ſo, it muſt needs be; either becauſe men do not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider</hi> the <hi>Value</hi> of it; or, becauſe they do not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>There are (I fear) not a few pretending Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that, to ſave themſelves the trouble, and the care of working out this Salvation, do reject the Faith of it: To diſ-ingage themſelves from the bonds of Religion, eſpecially the Chriſtian (which indeed is the ſtricteſt,) will needs perſwade themſelves, It is but a politick Fiction, a mere Invention, a handſome Philoſophical Fable, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon mens Credulity, to keep them civil by the common Engines of Hope and Fear. They hold it to be againſt their Intereſt in this Life, to believe there is any other, though it be not ſafe to deny it in this part of the World. From ſuch perſons I ſhall <hi>turn away;</hi> leaving them to the Conviction, which they will only admit, <hi>viz.</hi> that of their own Senſes in another World. Their own ſenſes, I ſay, becauſe our Saviour hath told me that no other will move them; <hi>If one ſhould come from the Dead</hi> (to tell them what he had ſeen or felt there) <hi>they would not be perſwaded.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 16.31.</note> For they have, not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets only, but all the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and all the Martyrs, together with an infinite number of Miracles (witneſs'd with as much Evidence, as any matter of Fact is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of) to perſwade their belief. And if all this be inſufficient, I am not ſo vain as to hope to give them any better Evidences of the Truth. But have reaſon to paſs them by, with the Cenſure of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. <hi>As</hi> Jannes <hi>and</hi> Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:192161:100"/>
               <hi>withſtood</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſo do theſe alſo reſiſt the Truth; men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the Faith:</hi> The Motive which I am urging to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to the work which the Text requires, ſuppoſeth their belief of this Salvation; and needs nothing to make it effectual, but a ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the tranſcendent excellency and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of this Deſign above any other. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is put to iſſue, the queſtion in ſhort is, Whether we deſire to live for ever in Glory and Happineſs, with Chriſt and his holy Angels in Heaven; or have our Portion with Devils and Reprobates, in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone, the place of utter Darkneſs, where there is nothing but weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth. Now, were there no more than a mere poſſibility, or probability at moſt, of theſe Events to a man, without any convincing Evidence of their certainty; yet were it extreamly unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to neglect them: eſpecially when as the means requiſite to the ſecuring them, are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, in compariſon of the value and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the ends; and otherwiſe ſo highly valuable in themſelves.</p>
            <p>To him therefore that hath any Doubts ariſing in his mind about the truth of thoſe things which the Goſpel declareth concerning the Judgment to come, Hell and Heaven, and is thereby tempted to neglect them; I ſhall only propound by way of Advice towards his reſcue from ſuch a fatal hazard, theſe three Queſtions, to be deliberated upon, before he abandons himſelf to ſuch a deſperate Courſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether there be any impoſſibility in the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:192161:100"/>ſubſtance of theſe Doctrines; that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life after this, with a General Judgment to come upon all men? that there are Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments for men in that future Life, proportion'd to the Actions of this Life? Can it be demonſtrated that the futurity of theſe Events, doth import Contradiction to any known Verities?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is there no probabilitie of the truth of them? Do not all the Teſtimonies and Arguments that have been alledged for their confirmation, with the general conſent of almoſt all the Nations of the World, as well Heathens as Chriſtians, amount to ſo much as a probability of the truth of them? And if they be poſſible, and in any degree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, doth it not follow that they may be true?</p>
            <p>And then my third Queſtion, that I would adviſe ſuch a doubtful perſon ſeriouſly to conſider of, is no more but this; What if they ſhould prove true? And, if after theſe Conſiderations he can be ſo deſperate, as to continue in the neglect of theſe Events, without any care to provide for them, and can arreſt his mind with <hi>Heſter's</hi> Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>If I periſh, I oeriſh;</hi> Who can help it? So much for the firſt Motive.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is from the neceſſity of man's Working to the obtainment of this End: which is a thing not to be had or hoped for without Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Labouring, Working, Striving: Not a thing that comes by Fate, or Fortune, or by any abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute inconditional Decree. All the hopes we can have of this happineſs, are grounded upon the Promiſes of the Goſpel, and thoſe limited by the Conditions, which have been before declared in the Explication of this Work. There is no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:192161:101"/>of Salvation to be found in Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome or other of thoſe Conditions are not expreſſed, and all the reſt underſtood. Or, if there be any ſemblance of an abſolute Promiſe, it ought certainly to be interpreted by the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, by which it is limited. For, What if it can be found in Scripture that God hath ſaid, He will ſave ſome, to wit, a certain number of Elect Perſons, without mention of any Character, by which they may be diſtinguiſhed? That ſure is a Prediction, rather than a Promiſe; or, if we will call it a Promiſe, yet it can never be capable of any Application to a particular perſon, in ſuch indefinite terms; nor till it be explicated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by ſome conditional Promiſe.</p>
            <p>But againſt this neceſſity of working for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may be objected that, Salvation is a gift of free grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Anſwer to the Objection from theſe Texts, is clearly ſuggeſted in the laſt of them: (wherein the ſtrength of the Objection chiefly lies) to wit, in the ſpecification; Firſt of this Gift or Grace, by the relative term of a Reward; And ſecondly of the Work, as being ſuch as makes the Reward to be of Debt: 1. Thus Grace is termed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:192161:101"/>a Reward, as it is alſo called in other Texts, <hi>The Reward of the Inheitrance: And the Recompence of the Reward:</hi> Rev. 22.12.
<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>My Reward is with me, to give to wery man, according as his Work ſhall be.</hi> A Reward cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to ſome Work: A free Gift may be without any Condition, but not ſuch a one as is reckon'd for a Reward: Whereas therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To him that worketh the Reward is not reckon'd of Grace but of Debt,</hi> He cannot be underſtood to ſpeak of all manner of Work (without contradiction to himſelf in the term of a Reward,) but of ſuch only as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Free Grace, that is, Meritorious Work, and ſuch as makes the Reward to be a due debt: But no ſuch work can be done by a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Though God may oblige himſelf in point of Truth to his Creature, by his free Promiſe; yet he can never be obliged by it in point of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, by any Work of his Creature, to any Reward (much leſs to ſuch an one, as is ſo infinitely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable to any poſſibility of their Works.) Becauſe all that can be done by a Creature in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to God's Will, (that is, all the good that can be done by him) is a due Debt to the Creator. But where the Work is a Debt, the Reward (if any be given) can be none: Beſides, it is abſurd, to think that any man can be bound to reward his own Works. But every good Work is the Effect of God's grace; <hi>For it is God that worketh in us to will, and to do, of his good pleaſure:</hi> So that, this Condition of Evangelical Works, doth not eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the freedom of God's grace, nor yet dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:192161:102"/>it, but rather advance it: Seeing thoſe Works, as well as the Reward, are the Effects of his grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But how little moment there is in this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, muſt needs appear to him that firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, (that which no body but an Atheiſt, or an Epicurean will deny, <hi>viz.</hi>) that there is no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Salvation of the Body, Life, Health, or any other good thing in this World, but is alſo the gift of God: And ſecondly, conſiders, what neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity there is of humane induſtry, care, and pains, to the obtainment of ſome (at leaſt) of theſe Gifts.</p>
            <p>And this Anſwer, if it be duly adverted, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſolve an other Objection, againſt the neceſſity of Working, in order to Salvation drawn from</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Object.</hi> the Doctrine of Predeſtination. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Salvation which the Text ſpeaks of, is not only a free Gift of God; but ſuch a one as is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to none, but them to whom it is predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And to them it is ſo certain, as can never fail, without the fruſtration of the Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; What need then of our ſollicitude or labour to work it out? Is it our part to take care that God be not deceived in his Providence, or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his Decrees?</p>
            <p>They that make this Objection, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
               </label> ſhall need no other Anſwer, than that which they ſhall be able to make to themſelves, in reference to the following Queſtions. 1. Whether they do believe, that any kind of temporal, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſalvation, or any other worldly good thing, is given to any, but them to whom it is predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated? Or (which is all one) whether God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees do not extend, as well to things Temporal,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:192161:102"/>as to eternal? Secondly, ſuppoſing they do, What need is there of any work or care of man's, for any end or purpoſe whatſoever? What need ſo much toil of the Husbandman to plow and ſow, and mannure his ground, ſeeing his Crop (if he ſhall have any) is predeſtinate? What need any working for meat, drink, or rayment? Nay what need of Meat, Rayment, Phyſick? what need of Eating, or Drinking, in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevation of life, or health? what needs any care or defence to preſerve the body from the moſt immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger that can be? ſeeing that all preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, and health is decreed by God? The anſwer which any ſober man can make to himſelf, as to theſe queſtions, will fully ſuffice to diſcharge his mind from the temptation of this old Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Seeing he cannot but underſtand, that it may be altogether as true, that no body is predeſtinate to Salvation, but he that indeavours to work it out with fear and trembling; as it is, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is predeſtinate to live, in bodily health, and ſafety, but he that eats, and drinks, and avoids ſuch things as would neceſſarily deſtroy his life. And that the certainty of the End doth not take away, but rather inferre, the neceſſity of the Means,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Motive, may be taken from the equity and reaſonableneſs of this work: There is nothing required of us in order to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this great Salvation, but what, as reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men, we muſt conclude to be altogether juſt; and indiſpenſably neceſſary. To believe in the Son of God, (after that he hath been ſufficiently declared to be ſo, by all reaſonable evidences);
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:192161:103"/>obey Him, to whom all power in Heaven, and Earth is given, and whom God hath made Lord of quick, and dead; To repent of, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all known ſin; To deny all ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world; To love God with all the heart, and all the ſoul, and all the might, and our neighbours as our ſelves; To do to others as we would they ſhould do to us: Theſe, and whatever other Chriſtian duty, is required, as part of the condition of Salvation, are things ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently juſt, and reaſonable, as will admit of no colour of exception againſt them.</p>
            <p>Let us but examine what thoſe things are, which are required of us, to render us capable of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and judg, Which of them, we could wiſh with any face of reaſon to have been abated. Would we be ſaved by Chriſt without believing in him? without acknowledging him for a Saviour? without any dependence upon him? Would we have the Son of God to be ſent from Heaven, on purpoſe to preach the Goſpel of Salvation to us, and our ſelves not bound to believe on him? Or would we be bound to believe his Doctrine to be the Will of God, but not be obliged to practiſe it? Would we believe in him for a <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> and have liberty to reject him as a <hi>Lord?</hi> Would we, that he ſhould have nothing to do to exact any ſervice or obedience from us, that hath bought us with the price of his own blood? Is it reaſonable to accept his Promiſes, and refuſe his Precepts? Or, would we have a pardon for all our ſins paſt without the condition of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; that is, with a licence, or diſpenſation to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:192161:103"/>continue in them ſtill, if we pleaſe? Would we be happy but not holy? Would we be Devils in this world, and Angels in the next? ſerve the Devill, the profeſſed enemy of God, and our own Souls, whiles we are here on Earth; and yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have communion with the moſt pure and holy God, hereafter in Heaven? Can we contrive a way, How light and darkneſs, righteouſneſs, and unrighteouſneſs, ſhould have fellowſhip one with an other? Would we have God to be reconciled to us in the free pardon of all our offences, and we not reconciled to him, but ſtill be allowed to live in a courſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt him? Would we injoy his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and love, and not be bound to love him? or would we be acknowledged to be true lovers of God, without any reſpect to his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Would we injoy the grace of adoption, the bleſſing of ſons, and the inheritance of the Kingdom, with a deſpenſation for the duty of fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al obedience? If theſe terms be ſo unreaſonable, as no man can have impudence enough to own the deſire of them; What objection can we have againſt any of the conditions of Salvation? which conſiſt in no harder matters, than thoſe which our own Reaſon is forced to acknowledg ſo juſt, and indiſpenſable, that, if we had been called to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell about them, and had had our negative vote in the paſſing of them; or, if we had been left to our ſelves, to have ſet down our own terms, for our Juſtification, and Salvation; we could never have ſet them lower, than they are ſet in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The fourth Motive to the utmoſt of diligence
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:192161:104"/>to be uſed in this work, is to be drawn from the difficultie of performing it. If we have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to work out a buſineſs of much difficulty, is there not a great neceſſity we ſhould attend it with proportionable diligence? Moſt true it is, in reſpect of the equity, and reaſonableneſs of this work (above declared) there is indeed nothing in it that is hard, conſidered in it ſelf; which is enough to verifie the words of our Saviour, <hi>My yoak is eaſie and my burthen is light;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 11.30. 1 Joh. 5.3.</note> as well as thoſe of his Apoſtle, <hi>His command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not grievous.</hi> Chriſt's yoke is not like that of a cruel or hard Maſter, nor his burthen like that of a tyrannical Lord: His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are no harder than ſuch as become the moſt gratious and mercifull Father: ſo farre is he from requiring any thing of us, which is either impoſſible or unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>Certainly it imports notorious repugnancy to the name and notion of the Goſpel; if not blaſphemie of the Divine Goodneſs, therein proclaimed, to ſay, or imagin that God ſhould abuſe mankind, with pretences of ſuch infinite grace, and mercy, promiſed under ſuch conditions, as we are in no capacity to perform: as having neither any ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereunto of our ſelves, nor any ground of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting it from him, who only is able to afford it. If it be the Will and command of God (as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it is) that every one to whom the promiſe of Salvation is made known, by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould (not only believe the general truth of it, but alſo) make particular application of it to his own comfort; (elſe how is it a Goſpel, or Glad tidings?) certainly that very command
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:192161:104"/>(without any new promiſe) implies a juſt warrant of confidence in him that gives it, to ſupply us with a ſufficiency of ability to perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of his promiſe, if, being willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake them, and ſenſible of our own inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we ſhall ſincerely ſeek this ability from him. But (to balk all matter of Diſpute) it is without controverſie, that ſuch perſons, are as the proper objects of this exhortation (that is, ſuch as have, by the grace of God, already begun this work) have as ſure promiſes of ſufficient grace to go through withall, as they have of the Reward of it, being once finiſhed:
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note> The promiſes before mentioned (by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the words after my Text) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſufficient to ſecure us from any inſuperable difficulty in this work. But do not therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr that there is none; but rather the contrary; Becauſe, if there were no difficulty, we ſhould need no ſuch ſecurity for our aſſiſtance to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it.</p>
            <p>But of the Difficulties which are to be expected, and incountred, in the purſuance of this work, we are ſufficiently advertiſed, as well by Scripture, as by our own ſenſible and continual Experience, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtraitgate:</hi>

And (to quote no more Texts in ſo evident a matter) whoſoever underſtands what this work is, cannot be ignorant of the difficultie thereof, Wherein ſo many ſtrong luſts of the fleſh, are to be mortified, the Old man to be crucified, Self to be denied, the Croſs to be taken up: So many duties to God, Our ſelves, and our Neighbours, to be diligently performed. An infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of temptations, impediments, and ſnares, muſt be overcome: even as many as can be raiſed, or laid, by the wit and malice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, by all the variety of worldly things, both good, and bad, that may be deſired, or feared, to the prejudice of this deſigne; and by al lthe men that we converſe with in the world; The evil examples, inticements, diſcouragements, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of bad men; The errors, infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſcandalous miſcarriages of good men. There is ſcarce any perſon or thing in the world that we can have to do withall, but may miniſter ſome kind of temptation to divert us from the ſtrictneſs of a holy life. But to all thoſe difficulties that can be created to us from without, the greateſt addition is given by our Selves, from our own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold imperfections, infirmities, corruptions, and carnal diſpoſitions, comprehended under the general name of the fleſh. <hi>For the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other, ſo that ye cannot do
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:192161:106"/>the thing that ye would.</hi> Gal. 5.17. By all which conſiderations, it is abundantly evident, that this ſaving work is full of difficultie, and therefore not to be finiſhed without great diligence.</p>
            <p>Neither ought it to be a wonder that ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe reward, as that of an eternal felicity, ſhould be charged with ſo much difficultie, as is enough to exerciſe the beſt of our diligence: it being Prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biably true amongſt men, that all excellent things are difficult to obtain; and if they were not ſo, they would be of no ſuch eſteem. A cheap and eaſie Victory gives not ſo much joy, as a difficult one. So undoubtedly the difficulties that we meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the way of Salvation (being overcome by the Grace of God) will much advance the joy of that victory, and render us capable of greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of glory than otherwiſe we ſhould be: That glory, as it is promiſed in Scripture, being to be diſpenſed by way of reward, will bear proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the labour, and difficultie of the work, not as meritorious in a ſtrict ſenſe, but as the effect and exerciſe of Divine grace: For, glory is the Crown of grace, not as that ſignifies a gift, habit, or infuſed quality, but as it works, or is exerciſed in us, by the co-operation of our own wills, effectually aſſiſted thereby: Hence it is that both Scripture, and Catholick ſenſe of the Church, doth attribute a ſpecial eminent degree of glory to <hi>Martyrs</hi> above other ordinary Saints. I ſay, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Saints, conceiving there will be as great a diſtinction of Saints, as Scripture intimates there is of Angels.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:192161:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>noble than others in the perfection of holineſs: Some <hi>Heroes,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Elias; Ahraham</hi> and <hi>David; Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and their collegues So will it be in the Kingdom of Heaven; <hi>One Starre will differ from anothr in glory</hi> And though Infants and Ideots (baptized eſpecially) will be ſaved, yet it is not probable that their glory will be equal to that of other Saints, who had leſs of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, but more of vertue in their Lives. And upon this account, it is juſtly deſirable that Infants Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed may live to adult years (though therehy they cannot but incurre ſome hazard of that ſalvation, whereof they were for that ſtate ſecured by their Baptiſm, as including the whole of the condition, or qualification required in them) not only that they may glorifie God here (which is the end of our Being and therefore ought to be deſired); but alſo that themſelves may be qualified for a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of glory, than their baptiſmal grace, never proved or excerciſed, can be concluded to give them.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſame reaſon, I ſuppoſe it not to be the intereſt of Chriſtians, to deſire to get to Heaven with the leaſt difficultie that may be: Not only, becauſe thereby we ſhall glorifie God ſo much the leſſe by how much the leſs the excerciſe and trial of our love, and obedience, ſhall be: But alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by that means alſo, the ſtate, and degree of our future glory and happineſs, may be abated, and that (for ought we know) to all eternity. This conſideration may afford great incouragement, and conſolation to Chriſtians, againſt the ſpecial and extraordinary difficulties that they may meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the way of Salvation above others: Namely
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:192161:107"/>that all their <hi>labour of love</hi> will be undoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, in the free and bountifull reward.</p>
            <p>But now againſt all the difficulties, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments that are to be mett with in this great work, we have alſo this further comfort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, <hi>viz.</hi> That as we have many ſorts of temptations, many lets, impediments, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to paſſe through in this buſineſs; ſo have we as many (and indeed more variety of) helps, aids, ſuccours, aſſiſtances, and incouragements, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our inabling to go through withall. The means of gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e are more various, and more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent than the motives to ſin: For in oppoſition to the three generall principles and cauſes of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil, we have more than ſo many counterforces, ſtrengths, auxiliaries, and motives, to withſtand thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</p>
            <p>As for inſtance, to incounter the Fleſh, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, every Chriſtian hath the promiſed aſſiſtance of the Spirit and grace of God, <hi>For the ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh.</hi> Beſides to oppoſe the inordinate luſt of carnal affections, and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, every man hath the faculties of Reaſon, and Conſcience; which if they be not rejected, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, will do him ſome ſervice in this ſpiritual warfarre.</p>
            <p>Againſt the temptations of the World, that is, of the things of the World, good or evil, by way of deſire or fear; a man hath (if he believes the Scripture,) firſt, the ſame kind of things of both ſorts, to confront his temptations, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Bleſſings in this Life, to him that, denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, will live ſoberly,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:192161:107"/>righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent World, <hi>(For Godlineſs hath the promiſe of this Life;)</hi> and in the Threatnings of all ſorts of Puniſhments in this World to him that doth not ſo. And ſecondly, he hath, beſides this, the things of an other World, both good and evil, to deſire and fear, infinitely greater than any thing, wherewith he is liable to be tempted in this World.</p>
            <p>Then, againſt temptations from the men of the World of all ſorts, we have alſo the Exhortations, Counſels, Admonitions, and Examples of good men, together with the Prayers of the whole Church, to ſtrengthen our patience, excite and encourage our affections and indeavours to conſtancy in a holy life: Beſides the examples of puniſhments upon bad men.</p>
            <p>Againſt the evil Spirit, we have the good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which is infinitely ſtronger. Againſt the Devil and all wicked Spirits, we have the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of good Angels, who cannot be ſuppoſed to have leſs power and will to aſſiſt and further us unto all well doing, than the Devils have to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us, or tempt us to evil. The opinion of an
<note n="*" place="margin">Angelus-Cuſtos.</note> Angel-keeper allotted to every good man, is more received, and more probable, than that of the evil <hi>Genius,</hi> or the
<note n="*" place="margin">Et tentans.</note> tempting Angel. And if neither be certain, as to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity, yet the common aſſiſtance of the one, is as credible as the oppoſition of the other ſort of Spirits. But that which gives us the moſt certain advantage, is, the promiſed aſſiſtance of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by his all-ſufficient grace, if we will ſeek, embrace, and improve it. The <hi>Father</hi> is our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:192161:108"/>Father, ready to hear and help us, knows our weakneſs, and how to deliver us from, or out of, temptation. The <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Son, hath overcome both World and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<note place="margin">John 16.33.</note> not for himſelf only, but for us; having merited for us a ſufficiency of Grace to do the like. As our Head, and King, he is able, and willing to aſſiſt us againſt all temptation, and to furniſh us with all <hi>grace for grace.
<note place="margin">John 1.16.</note> The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents Head.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> And, <hi>The holy Spirit,</hi> abideth in us (if we be true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) to work in us to will and to do, what ever is required at our hands.</p>
            <p>Beſides all theſe, we have the <hi>Holy Word of God</hi> to teach us our Duty by way of inſtruction, and to excite us to the performance thereof by rich and precious promiſes, and to deterr us from ſin by ſevere threatnings: And ſpecial Promiſes we have too, in the ſame <hi>Word,</hi> (if we will take any care to obſerve the implicite conditions of them in our own indeavours);
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.14.</note> That <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over us;</hi> That <hi>God will beat down Satan under our feet;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 16.20.</note> That <hi>he will not ſuffer us to be tempted, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that we are able, but will with the temptation, make way for our eſcape:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13.</note> that we may be able to bear it.</hi> All theſe things conſidered, and compared, it is evident that <hi>thoſe that are with us are more, and ſtronger, than thoſe that are againſt us.</hi> Our aids, and our Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces againſt temptations are ſtronger, than all our Enemies: which abundantly clears the Juſtice and Goodneſs of God, in permitting, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:192161:108"/>all the temptations which we meet withall in this World: And leaves us without excuſe from any of them: Affording us a ſufficient incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the work we have to do.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A fift Motive to the proſecution of this Work with fear and trembling, is to be drawn from the ſhortneſs, and uncertainty of the time, wherein it is to be wrought out, which we all know is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably limited to the term of this life: And therefore, that which our Saviour ſaith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf (<hi>Jo.</hi> 9.4. <hi>I muſt work the Works of him that ſent me, while it is Day: the Night cometh, when no man can work,</hi>) doth as much concern every one of us to conſider: and ſomething more, in in reſpect that he knew the length of his Day, and the certain Hour of the Night's approaching, which is impoſſible for us to do. We are ſure, <hi>There is no Work nor Invention in the Grave,</hi> whither we are going; and how near, we may be to the brink of that, we cannot learn without a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which no man in his Wits, will expect. They are in a ſad condition then, that have all this work to do, when they know not whether they ſhall have an hour to diſpatch it in; but they in a ſadder, that will ſtill deferr it. Certainly, there is no inſtance of preſumption in the World, that can parallel the deſperate folly of this dilato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs in a Buſineſs of ſuch infinite Concernment.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I know, it is not in the power of words to expreſs the madneſs of this practiſe; I ſhall not make any further attempt to ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But, inſtead of a weak declamation againſt ſuch a folly as is above all meaſures of rhetorical aggravation, I ſhall only (in compaſſion to the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:192161:109"/>Souls of men) propound, to them that may be perſwaded to weigh them, a few ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that although we be fully aſſured, by our Saviour's Parable, that he that comes in at the eleventh hour, may poſſibly find time enough, to finiſh this Work:
<note place="margin">Mat. 20.6.12.</note> yet that (for ought any man can know) that hour may be already paſt with him; yea, and the very twelfth may not want many minutes of being ſpent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; with which the day of Salvation muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily expire; and to recover any minute of it, will be as impoſſible, as to recall Yeſterday.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is worth the inquiry, Whether thoſe perſons that came in, and were accepted, at the eleventh hour, had ever been called before, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to obey: For if they had not, or it cannot appear that they had, their Example is vaſtly different from the Caſe of ſuch, as have perhaps been called every hour of the day, and have always refuſed, with a pertinacious wilfulneſs, preſumptuouſly deferring their obedience to the laſt. And though the negative of their former Calling, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fully proved, yet there is a ſtrong preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it, from their own words, if they ſignifie any thing in the Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.6, 7. <hi>And about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others ſtanding idle, and ſaith unto them, Why ſtand ye here all the day idle? They ſay unto him, Becauſe no man hath hired us:</hi> What theſe words ſhould mean, is ſcarce accountable, if they do not ſignifie that that was the firſt time they had been called to work.</p>
            <p>And for the Thief upon the Croſs, who came
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:192161:109"/>not in, till the end of the twelfth hour, and yet had the priviledge of accompanying his Saviour, the ſame day, into the Heavenly Paradiſe; it is no leſs uncertain, whether ever he met with Chriſt before, or had heard ſo much of him, as could rationally oblige his Faith. Beſides, there were ſo many ſingularities of Circumſtance in his Caſe, (impoſſible to be found in any other) as, being conſidered by one that is not willing to deceive his own Soul, can afford no more than a bare Remedy againſt abſolute Deſpair at the laſt Moment.</p>
            <p>It is doubtleſs, a very rational truth, that one heroïcal act of Vertue, may have a juſt Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to a multitude of ordinary ones. And the ſervice of a quarter of an hour, may poſſibly, by it's degrees of intenſion in the zeal, as well as by the extraordinary matter of it, be as conſiderable as that of many years: Such perhaps is that of a ſudden, free, and zealous Martyrdom; whereof there is ſome ſtore of Examples in Eccleſiaſtical Story. And whether the acknowledgement of Chriſt, with ſo full and free Confeſſion of Faith in him, by one that had been ſo much a Stranger to him, at ſuch a time, when the Faith of all men, was ſo much diſcouraged, and that of his own Diſciples, ſo much ſhaken; was not equivalent to that of any Martyr, is a reaſonable Problem: That is, Whether upon all due conſiderations, it were not as great a Faith to believe in a dying Saviour, as it can be to die for a living one. It ſeems to me a very evident truth, that the ſtrength of this man's Faith did exceed that of any perſon living in the World, except the Bleſſed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:192161:110"/>Mother's. True it is, the Heathen Centurion, and ſome others, that were with him, did make a verbal profeſſion of a like Faith in him, when they ſaid, <hi>Truly, this was the Son of God:</hi> Matth. 27.54. But it is obſervable, that that perſwaſion was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them, only by the ſight of the many Miracles, and Prodigies which followed his death, which the Thief lived not to ſee. Beſides (to diſmiſs this Example with one Conſideration more, from the Circumſtance of the time when it happened) for any wilful impenitent Sinner to preſume of Pardon at laſt, notwithſtanding his preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, by the incouragement of this ſingular Example, hath apparently no more of reaſon in it, than it would be in a common Malefactor to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon Capital Crimes, upon the hope of a general Pardon, by the Example of ſuch a thing once granted by his Prince, at his Coronation.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Conſideration againſt the delay of this Work, is to be drawn from the multitude of Examples of ſuch as (by unexpected Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their Death) have been prevented of all poſſibilities of doing any thing towards it: by reaſon of ſuddenneſs either of Death, or (which makes the Caſe perfectly equal) of the loſs of Underſtanding. Were the Examples of ſuch a fatal pretenſion, as rare and ſingular, as that of the dying Thief's effectual Converſion; yet, conſidering the infinite moment of it's Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, they ſhould in reaſon be far greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Fear, and Caution, againſt Delay, than that can be of Hope or Incouragement in it. But this Conſideration is much to be advanced by the innumerable contingencies, and poſſibilities, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:192161:110"/>may cauſe ſuch an abſolute prevention: or at leaſt may ſhorten, and determine that remainder of time that a ſinner can hope to have, to work out his ſalvation. Certain it is, that every man's glaſs is turn'd for his Life, but what the Content of it is, is impoſſible to know: Whiles every man knows that the contingencies of it's being broken, or ſuddenly exhauſted, are more than the number of Sands in the biggeſt Glaſs that is: To go about to collect the number of Caſualties by which the life of man hath been cut off, were an endleſs bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: and yet ſo far ſhort of the poſſibilities by which it may be, as is not imaginable.</p>
            <p>A third Conſideration againſt delay in this Work, may be this: That ſeeing nothing doth provoke the wrath of God ſo much as preſumption in Sin, it is juſtly to be conceived that the meaſure, and continuance of ſuch preſumption is the moſt probable thing that can be, to determine the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of God's patience, and to move him to give up a ſinner to ſuch a penal, invincible hardneſs of heart, as will make it impoſſible for him to repent. We read of God's hardening the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> after he had ſo ſtubbornly hardened himſelf, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the admonitions that had been given him by the mouth, and hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Now God's hardening <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart, doth undoubtedly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the withdrawing of that Grace which was neceſſary for his Converſion, which left him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of perdition. And this puniſhment (the ſevereſt that a man is capable of, out of Hell,) is therefore juſtly to be feared by him that wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delayes his Repentance; becauſe ſo to do, is an extreme preſumption; And though it be poſſible
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:192161:111"/>for ſuch a perſon, (notwithſtanding this provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) to obtain Grace, not only ſufficient, but effectual to Salvation; yet no perſon is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely ſo to do. Such perſons have leaſt reaſon to hope for that Grace, and moſt cauſe to fear the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it.</p>
            <p>Every man that believes any thing in the matter of Religion, muſt needs be convinc'd that he ows his whole Life to the ſervice of God. Now for him that cannot but acknowledge, he owes all his time to God's ſervice, and hath already waſted the greateſt part of it, in following his own luſts, and in a courſe of rebellion againſt God, ſtill to withold, deliberately, and preſumptuouſly, that unknown part of it, which remains, is ſuch a degree of wickedneſs as, though God may pardon, no man can tell, Whether he will or no. And though we are aſſured he will accept the Work of his own Grace whenſoever it takes effect; yet we have little reaſon to hope he will afford that Grace, to ſuch as deſire not to partake of it, till it cannot be ſerviceable to him: let this then be the fifth Argument or Motive, to ſtir up Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to the diligent purſuit of this Work; The ſhortneſs of the time that we have to finiſh it in, together with the extreme hazard of delaying it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I ſhall add but one Argument more, which is to be drawn from the infinite love and mercy of God, which he hath ſhewed in this Deſign of our Salvation, contrived and procured by the Incarnation of his Eternal Son; and effected by the ſhedding of his moſt precious Bloud, <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, to redeem us from all Iniquity, and to purifie to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:192161:111"/>good Works. For we know, that we are not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, from our vain Converſation, but with the precious Bloud of Chriſt.</hi> And ſhall we now neglect that great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that infinite Grace, that coſt ſo dear the procuring? Ought we not to eſtimate the Worth and excellency of this end, by the means, whereby it was effected? Will any wiſe Agent beſtow more Coſt upon a thing than it is worth? The infinite worth of the Means, uſed by ſo wiſe a Contriver, doth fully confirm the excellency of the End: which in it ſelf doth ſo much tranſcend the hopes of ſuch poor Mortal Creatures. The height and dignity of that <hi>far more exceeding eternal weight of Glory,</hi> the Felicity of that State, together with the Immutability thereof, is rendred credible, by the Means whereby it was purchaſed. For, had it not been a glorious and immutable thing, ſurely God would never have deſigned to bring it about by ſuch an Infinite Project: And though God needs not the glory of our Salvation, no more than he doth that of our preſent Service; yet how much he values both, is to be eſtimated by the Price that was given for it, Now then, to deſpiſe or neglect this End, that was procured by ſuch a coſtly Means, how hainous a Sin muſt it needs be, <hi>To tread under foot the Bloud of the Son of God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude my Diſcourſe, with ſome ſpecial Directions how to proſecute this Work with the beſt advantage.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe (as we read in the following verſe) <hi>It is God that worketh in us to will, and to do, of his good pleaſure,</hi> it behoves us to pray earneſtly, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and conſtantly, for the effectual aſſiſtance
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:192161:112"/>of his grace. That Godly <hi>fear and trembling</hi> which the Text requires, ſerves to drive us to God, in the humble ſenſe of our own danger, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency: And we have a promiſe that, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Rom. 10.13, Not that this is all that is required to Salvation, but that he that doth ſo, ſhall not want any aſſiſtance of Gods grace neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And that <hi>he will give the holy Spirit to them that aske it,</hi> Luk 11.13. Alwaies ſuppoſed that, we aske aright, with ſincere, and earneſt deſire to receive and improve the gift; which requires, that we be carefull, not to <hi>receive the grace of God in vain,</hi> not to reſiſt or quench the ſpirit: as is uſually done by many that daily pray for his grace in a formal, and hypocritical manner. The ſucceſſe of our prayers, depends upon the ſincerity of our deſires which is only verified by our diligent indeavors to obtain the things we pray for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe the Word of God, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Goſpel is <hi>the power of God unto ſalvation, able to ſave our ſoules, to make us wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> it concerns us to attend diligently to the reading, hearing, and meditating of this Divine Word: and that not only becauſe it affords unto us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection how to attain this end, by informing us concerning the conditions thereof; but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a powerfull mean to work them in u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> The holy Spirit, by which God worketh in us both to Will and to do, breathes in the Word and is ordinarily conveyed thereby, into the ſouls of men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe, although this work canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be done for us by any other perſons, yet it may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:192161:112"/>promoted by their aſſiſtance, we have great reaſon to deſire the aſſiſtance of Chriſtian brethren, by their charitable admonitions, counſel, conference, and prayers. And this help is moſt deſirable from them that are beſt qualified to afford it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, eſpecially from our ſpirituall Paſtors and Teachers: without neglect of faithful brethren. It is Saint <hi>James</hi> his advice, <hi>Confeſs your ſins one to another, and pray one for another,
<note place="margin">Jam. 5 16.</note> the effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> When men are to work out ſome temporall intereſt, to ſave themſelves from danger, or to obtain any preferment, they will deſire the aſſiſtance of others, eſpecially ſuch as are moſt able to further them in it: And have we not as much, and a great deal more reaſon to do ſo, in this ſpiritual deſign?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It behooves us to take great heed (not only of all ſuch things as do directly oppoſe this work, as being contrary to it, ſuch are all ſinful practices and cuſtomes, but alſo) of all hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and divertiſements from it. Such as are found in the world: The men of the world, and the things of the world.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The men of the world, by their vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, evil example, and otherwayes, are great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to the ſerious proſecution of this work. And therefore it behooves Chriſtians, to have as little familiarity with them as they may. <hi>Depart from me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) for I will keep the commandments of my God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.115.</note> it is not an eaſie thing to keep the commandements of God in the company of evil doers: <hi>I have not ſate with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:192161:113"/>vain perſons:</hi> (ſaith he again) <hi>neither will I go in with diſſemblers: I have hated the congregation of evil doers, and will not ſit with the wicked.</hi> As we ſhall have none of their company in Heaven, ſo neither ſhould we deſire or delight in it on Earth, becauſe it hinders us in our way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The things of the World are very great incumbrances, and lets in this holy work: The profits, Pleaſures, and Preferments of this world, though innocent in themſelves, yet do very much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ivert men from the purſuit of true holineſs, and happineſs. <hi>They that will be rich</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9.</note> which drown men in deſtruction and perdition.
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 2.4.</note> No man that warreth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth himſelf with the affairs of this life, that he may pleaſe him, who hath choſen him to be a ſouldier.</hi> Take heed of being too ſollicitous for thy portion in this world, leſt that prove to be all that thou ſhalt have; The generality of men loſe all the treaſures, joys, and glories of Heaven, by being too covetous of the ſuppoſed lawfull riches, pleaſures, and honours of this world. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the words of our Saviour: how hard a thing it is (though not impoſſible) for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of Heaven. If thou wouldeſt be ſure to ſave thy ſoul, <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. If thou wouldſt once be happy indeed, content thy ſelf here in this world with the hopes of it in an other life; and doe not ſeek to anticipate it in the injoyments of this world.</p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:192161:113"/>
            <p>Fifthly, Examine thy ſelf often and ſeriouſly, whether this work be truly begun, and how it goes forward: It is the exhortation of the Apoſtle; <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the faith, prove your own ſelves,</hi> 1 Cor 13.5. It behooveth Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to put the queſtion to themſelves, whether they be in the right Faith, whether they be true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers or no: whether they be duly qualified for this Salvation, according to the conditions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the promiſes: Do I indeed believe in the Lord Jeſus with an unfained Faith,? How is this Faith perfected or verified by my works? Have I truly repented, and brought forth fruits worthy of repentance? Do I live after the fleſh or after the ſpirit,? Is it my ſtudy and diligent indeavour to cleanſe my ſelf from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and to perfect holineſs in the fear of God? Am I in the right way to Heaven or no? This practice of ſelf examination, is ſo much the more neceſſary, as it is eaſie to be deceived in a mans pretended title to this ſalvation: multitude of perſons are deceived, and wil finally periſh, that make account to be ſaved, and do not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their own condition. This is certainly the caſe of moſt men. For, almoſt all men do hope to be ſaved; and yet our Saviour tells us, that the gate is ſo narrow, and the way ſo ſtraight, that they are but few that will find it. How much then doth it concern us, <hi>To work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> to be exact and curious in this buſineſs, and to take heed of flattering our ſelves with vain hopes, and falſe grounds?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly, To ſecure this work, let us remember
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:192161:114"/>and obſerve carefully the precept of our Saviour and his Apoſtles:
<note place="margin">Mat. 13.13.</note> 
               <hi>Take heed, watch, and pray. Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the faith:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.13.</note> Be ſober, be vigilant; becauſe your adverſary the devil,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8.</note> as a roaring Lion, walketh about ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.6.</note> Let us not ſleep as do others, but let us watch and be ſober.</hi> Take heed of ſpiritual ſloth, and that thou fall not aſleep in ſin, and ſecurity. Remember the parable of the fooliſh Virgins, that ſlept away their opportunity of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Lord, and were ſhut out of his company. There is no general practice ſo uſefull, and neceſſary to the keeping of a good conſcience, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of holmeſs, as this of conſtant watchfulneſs over our ſelves: The want whereof is the cauſe of mens neglect of, and miſcarriage in this work.</p>
